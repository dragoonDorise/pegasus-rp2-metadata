developer: GTE Entertainment

  As the name implies, this is strictly a basketball game. It has a
  black-basketball theme (as seen in a lot of odd American movies) and has a
  myriad of game options (one on one, group etc.).\n

game: Super Strike Gunner
file: Strike Gunner S.T.G..zip
developer: Activision
publisher: Activision
description:
  Strike Gunner S.T.G. is a vertical-scrolling jet fighter adventure set in the
  far-off year of A.D. 2008. The player controls their fighter as the scene
  unfolds around them, as enemies of air, land, and sea continuously enter the
  screen in wave after wave of assault. The player(s) begins with a set number of
  lives, a number which can be added to with good play. Run out, and your mission
  is over - there are no saves!
  .
  Before each level, the player chooses one special weapon that can be utilized
  via an often-refilled meter, in addition to their normal guns. But choose
  wisely, you can only use one special weapon per round, and once used, it will be
  unavailable to you in later rounds! Play solo or with a human wingman.

game: War 2410
file: War 2410.zip
developer: Advanced Productions
publisher: Advanced Productions
description:
  In the year 2003 geneticists tried to create the perfect soldier. Something went
  wrong however, and three new life forms turned against their creators: Brutally
  savage Orcs, cybernetic androids called Cromes and genetically enhanced human
  soldiers code named M.A.R.S. Players take control of a secretly assembled force
  and must try to restore order.
  .
  War 2410 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move various units, such
  as mechs, tanks, troops or planes over a grid-map. Units differ in movement and
  attacking range. Some ground units cannot attack air units and vice versa.
  Terrain also affects combat as some types of terrain, like trees or buildings
  improve a units defense. Attacked units always counterattack as long as the
  attacker is within range. The goal of most missions is to destroy all enemy
  units, while it is sometimes necessary to capture the enemies' bases. Units
  cannot not be improved or modified and every mission starts with all units
  already in place.

game: Super Metroid

developer: Nintendo
publisher: Nintendo
description:
  Super Metroid is a follow-up to Metroid II, and once again features bounty
  hunter Samus Aran. She heads to planet Zebes in order to hunt down the leaders
  of the Space Pirates, who kidnapped an unique Metroid larva.
  .
  Super Metroid is a platform game, which, like the previous Metroid games, is not
  divided into separate levels; the planet Zebes is an open world which Samus
  traverses back and forth. This world is divided into rooms separated with doors
  which must be shot to be opened. Shooting is also used to open up secret
  passages, some of which contain nifty bonuses, but finding most of them is
  required to proceed in the game.
  .
  There are many items to find on the way, and each new item usually makes
  heretofore inaccessible areas available to Samus. The items include both
  weaponry (such as missiles, super missiles, or upgrades to Samus's standard
  laser gun), energy tanks that increase Samus' max health, and other gadgets
  (like a grappling hook that allows Samus to stick to the ceiling).
  .
  There are various enemies - alien fauna - lurking around planet Zebes. The
  enemies all respawn after re-entering a room, though Samus' increasing
  capabilities mean that they become easier to defeat as the player makes
  progress. After killing them, the enemies typically leave behind some health or
  ammo.

game: Rpm - Radical Psycho Machine Racing
file: RPM Racing.zip
developer: Interplay
publisher: Interplay
description:
  RPM Racing was preceded by Rareware's R.C. Pro-Am in 1988 and Electronic Art's
  Racing Destruction Set in 1985, with the latter being the larger influence. It
  is a precursor to Rock 'n Roll Racing, which was done by the same developer.
  .
  Combat, obstacles, and traction on the non-flat tracks play a significant role.
  There are 3 vehicle types to choose from that perform differently on pavement,
  dirt, ice, flat or bumpy tracks. Cars can be armed with oil, nitro, and mines.
  Additionally, there are 3 levels of tires, engines, shocks, and armor.
  .
  There are full race season, single race, and custom track modes. In 1 player
  games, the 2nd player is replaced with one of 8 AI opponents who are each
  associated with their own vehicle.
  .
  In season mode, each track has an entrance fee and cash prize for placing 1st;
  often lesser cash prizes for lesser placements are also awarded. For an
  additional fee, racers can opt to move to a higher racing class (levels) where
  fees and prizes are bigger. Each class has its own set of tracks that the player
  may choose from. No track is mandatory or unavailable within a class. The player
  also has the option of going back to a lower class for free, which may become
  necessary if funds are eaten up be fees without winning prizes. However, going
  up always incurs a fee, even if the player has been there before.
  .
  Custom track designing is not intuitive but fairly easy to learn. Players can
  set the track's laps, gravity, and starting line type. Each track section can be
  pavement, dirt, or ice. Track sections are laid out like puzzle pieces on a 2D
  non-isometric grid (Pipe-Mania style). Sections include horizontal and vertical
  straights, four standard 90° turns, eight T-sections for diverging and
  converging multiple paths in any direction, and a criss-cross. Either a
  horizontal or vertical special straight section is used as the starting grid.
  The starting grid can be oriented forward, reversed, face-off with player 1
  forward, or face-off with player 1 reversed. 7 points are used to adjust the 6
  slopes in straight sections to 5 different heights. Slopes can be flat (0:1),
  inclined (1:1), or steep (2:1). Non-straight sections can only be adjusted for
  height for the entire section at once. An isometric view of individual sections
  is provided to help to orient the section's design to the adjacent sections. If
  the edge of a section does not match the height of the adjacent section(s), the
  player is warned immediately but may proceed without correcting the error
  immediately. But such error must be eliminated before the track can be saved.
  Also required for a track to be saved is no dead ends, and a starting grid
  section. The track verification is surprisingly liberal, even allowing diverging
  and converging paths that are against the flow of traffic (like turning around
  and going the wrong way up a freeway merging lane). The AI opponents are
  generally not able to discern the fastest or shortest route and can even be
  diverted into a path with no natural exit, or with very clever path designs,
  valid lap paths can be entirely different for player 1, player 2, and AI
  players; which can lead to interesting traffic patterns.

  Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this
  strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the
  available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some
  space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and
  trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses
  to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides
  that loop around other rides.
  .
  Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and
  souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to
  maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running
  smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.
  .
  You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage
  over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability
  closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that
  research is adequately funded to produce new rides.
  .
  It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park
  design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.

  process of being heavily delayed, eventually being released in 1994), this game
  saw Pond and friends competing in the underwater Olympics.
  .
  Most events had some sort of twist to them, to make them fit the underwater
  theme, or the style of humour seen in the James Pond series. The
  100-metre-splash is similar to joystick-waggling games of the 80s but also
  involves making timed jumps to hit seagulls. More unusual is Kipper Watching,
  which involves 'heading' incoming beach balls away from a troop of sleeping
  seals. There's also gymnastics, unicycle-riding, and a hurdles race of sorts.
  The events can be played by up to 4 players.

game: Lamborghini - American Challenge

developer: Titus
publisher: Titus
description:
  Starting out with just a basic Lamborghini and $6000, your aim is to rise to the
  top of the 4 divisions of racing through success on 60 racetracks across
  America. In each division there are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in
  each race at a time.
  .
  The races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions
  away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at
  normal speed, and police. before each race you will be told of the quality of
  the locals and the likelihood of police presence.
  .
  When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 Km/h could see you branded as
  an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase
  H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage
  (which eventually hampers your speed), or simply pull over and accept a fine and
  the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is
  heavier.
  .
  Each race costs money to enter, and your earnings can be boosted by betting on
  the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver
  gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower;
  if a local wins you get your stake back.
  .
  Lots of power-ups can be bought along the way, including tires, radar jammers,
  engine improvements and nitro boosts. To move up a division you must take the
  Divisional Challenge, a one-off trek through a tough section within the time
  limit. You buy a set of 3 passes for this, each allowing one attempt.

  The evil alliance under the leadership of Belser is attacking your world; as

  a large boss. You begin the game with a limited amount of fire power, but after
  shooting certain enemies power ups are left behind to increase your
  capabilities. Unlike many of the Darius games, if your ship is destroyed you
  don't lose all of the weapons you've collected; likewise you also continue on at
  the same point rather than being sent back to a checkpoint. Similar to many of

  KABOOM!

  Annie & Clint, two gunslingers, arrive at Carson City and get caught up in a
  gunfight. It's raining bullets and there are explosions everywhere. After an
  intense battle they enter the saloon where they dispose of every cowboy in sight
  while redecorating the interior. Our heroes flee the scene by climbing on the
  roof, but what's that sound? ... it's a HUGE robot!
  .
  Wild Guns is a shooter with a western & Sci Fi theme. Gameplay is somewhat
  similar to the Time Crisis & House of the Dead games, with the exception that
  the game isn't played from a first-person perspective but from a third-person
  perspective. You control your on-screen character as well as the aiming
  crosshair (at the same time). Select either Clint (yes, inspired by Mr.
  Eastwood) or Annie and shoot down tons of enemies while dodging bullets and
  jumping over incoming rockets.
  .
  After the Carson City level, the action continues in Desolation Canyon, an
  ammunition depot, a gold mine and a armored train (you can play these levels in
  any order). Finally there's a showdown with the big bad guy. Each of the 6
  levels is divided into 3 sublevels. The 3rd one is always a boss-battle. During
  the game your standard weapon can be temporarily upgraded by collecting
  power-ups. If you want to create some serious mayhem you can detonate one of
  your bombs. Almost any object in the background can be destroyed.
  .
  Wild Guns has a two-player co-op mode. There's also a shooting gallery mode in

  Izzy's Quest for the Olympic Rings is the official game of the mascot of the
  1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. As the name suggests, Izzy must find the five
  Olympic rings, hidden by the guardians so that Izzy does not take them to his
  world.
  .
  The game plays a lot like Mario games; to eliminate an opponent Izzy must jump
  over his head. There are two jumps available, the ball jump suitable for height
  and the hurdle jump, suitable for distance. Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy,
  but the second harms  him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at
  the next hit he loses a life. There are some extra objects, like Olympic
  torches, and eggs that hatch either objects for bonus points, trampolines or
  morph points to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or traps. Izzy can also morph
  into a glider, a baseball player, an archer or a rocket, among others, to
  overcome some sections of the levels.

  The people of Bizyland were hard-working and prosperous. However, Wagamama, the
  queen of Lasyland was jealous and used the power of her magic mirror. The spell
  that was cast would switch the realms of Bizyland and Lasyland around. The only
  people left unaffected by the spell were those who were not hard-working:
  notably the king of Bizyland as well as two children and a robot who were
  playing that day. Using the king's magic chalk, they must travel over Lasyland
  and restore enough of a percentage of each area so as to break the spell over
  each region.

  Cacoma Knight is a puzzle-painting game. Choosing one of the three characters,
  the player will begin each level only able to move around the edges. The player
  can start using the chalk to move away from the edges and draw a line over the
  darkened area and reach another edge. Once a section (always the smaller) is
  "chalked off" from the rest, it will be restored. Any treasure chests revealed
  will be opened for points bonuses. Different enemies will walk along the chalk
  lines or fly in between them. They can be destroyed by being in a section of the

  PPT (Pellet Projection Tube), a weapon capable of stunning a human from periods

  Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate

  Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the
  machine guns, and are shot to be collected.

  T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general
  concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns
  down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a
  besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy
  supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time
  to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet
  research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend
  off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.

  Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the
  wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To
  get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to
  build on.  The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be,
  so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing
  the same.

  When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a

  from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he
  gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will
  burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

  But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other
  tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering
  powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their
  best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who
  didn't build on high-ground.

description:
  The sequel to  Super Star Wars is, as the name implies, based on Episode V: The
  Empire Strikes Back, the second of the original  Star Wars movie trilogy. The
  game features familiar locations and events from the film, such as the ice
  planet Hoth, the search for Yoda on the jungle planet Dagobah, and the fight
  against Darth Vader. Several locations are expanded, adding places and boss
  enemies that did not exist in the movie, and certain key events in the story are
  omitted or changed.
  .
  As in the previous game, the player is able to control three characters: Luke
  Skywalker, Han Solo, and Chewbacca. Unlike the first, each character has been
  given a distinct special move. Chewie spins a path of destruction through
  enemies, Han has grenades and a powerful slide, and Luke can switch to his
  lightsaber and block oncoming fire. Gameplay is very similar to the first game,
  mostly focusing on platforming elements. As before, there are Mode-7 vehicle
  levels, during which the player is able to pilot a snowspeeder against
  encroaching Imperial walkers, pilot the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid
  field, and break through Cloud City's defenses in Luke's X-Wing fighter.
  .
  The game's other major addition is the inclusion of a suite of Force powers for
  Luke. They are learned by collecting hidden orbs on the Dagobah level, and add a
  second special bar that depletes with each usage of a Force power. Power-ups
  include health items, weapon upgrades, screen-clearing detonators, and orbs that
  restore Luke's Force power. Passwords have also been added, and are given upon
  completion of each of the game's 25 stages.

  the Earth. The once great continents have been drastically changed into
  thousands of tiny islands and various cities have washed into the oceans.
  During this turmoil,  Zorgeuf the Great rushes to conquer the bewildered world
  along with a troop of commanders and declares the Earth Empire. The only hope to
  defeat him lies from without Earth, as the Colonial Forces send a command
  carrier from the major orbital base. With so many armies gone, the ground
  infantry unit has been replaced by the Metal Marine, a fifty foot armored robot
  that can be sent into battle for attack or defense. From their respective
  Command Center, each side in the conflict will need to direct the placement of
  facilities on the ground to defend against enemy attack, manage resources and
  successfully strike the enemy.
  .
  Metal Marines is an isometric strategy game. Controlling one side of a conflict,
  the player must wage a campaign across several islands to defeat Zorgeuf and his
  lieutenants. The player controls logistics of the base to ensure that there are
  the necessary assets to wage war. On each map, the player places three
  underground command bases, if all of these are destroyed the battle is lost.
  The player must manage the resources of their money to construct new buildings
  or upgrade existing facilities on the map. Different buildings include Energy
  Plants, Factories, Economic Centers, Radar systems, Anti-Aircraft missiles, fake
  buildings and fake HQ bases, mine fields, gun pods, missile launchers, metal
  marine hangers and even ICBMs.  At any time, the player may order an attack and
  choose which assets to fire at the opponent. Missiles, Metal Marines carriers
  and ICBMs all use different levels of fuel. Metal Marines once deployed in an
  area will automatically fire rifles at nearby targets or engage even closer
  targets in melee attacks. Gunpods, while stationary, will also fire on nearby
  enemies. Metal Marines are largely autonomous but can be manually controlled to
  a minor degree (directional) by the player.

  obstacles, hidden treasures and some elementary lever-pulling kind of puzzle
  solving. Metaknight's Revenge is the only game on the cartridge with a (fairly
  strict) timer.  The Arena is a "boss rush" mode, asking players to defeat every

  F-Zero is a futuristic racing game, set in the year 2560. The player chooses one
  of the four available hovercars and then can race with other hovercars in one of
  the gameplay modes - "Practice" or "Grand Prix".
  .
  In "Practice" mode, the player chooses one track where he competes with one
  other hovercar to win the race (or there can be no rival at all, if you so
  wish). In "Grand Prix", the player must complete a series of races with several
  competitors. Each race consists of five laps.
  .
  The hovercar has a limited Power meter, which represents the machine's health
  and decreases when the hovercar collides with the track boundaries and other
  players. If power runs out, the hovercar explodes and the player loses the race.
  There are repair areas near the start line, which restore power to the player's
  hovercar if he drives into them. The tracks contain many more or less dangerous
  traps, such as icefields or landmines.
  .
  Completing a lap awards the player a "Super Jet" which can be activated at any
  time to give a short speed boost. The hovercar can keep up to three Super Jets
  and use them when necessary.
  .
  Completing a lap also gives points, which give the player a life when enough are
  accumulated. The player can lose a life in the Grand Prix mode if his hovercar

  increased by finding food. Every certain amount of points, a "Food Fairy"
  appears and drops off food as well.
  .
  Throughout your journey, you can smash open chests to find treasure and
  artifacts. Some of these artifacts can be recovered that alter gameplay, such as
  providing more damage or increased magical power. Also throughout your journey,

  help you defeat monsters, but also leave you an item that will help you on your
  quest. Only one person can join you at a time.

  As you progress through the tower, you will be granted new magical weapons after
  each boss you defeat. The weapons are affected by a "magic bar" that charges
  over time. When this bar is fully charged, the weapon has a powerful ranged
  attack, but when not charged only a close attack is produced. A magical staff
  will grant increased range attack ability. A magical blast may be generated by

  and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he
  notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs
  such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly
  increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the
  experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the
  drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the
  treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take
  revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to
  take over all computers in the world.

  protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the
  movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.

  of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional
  shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual
  World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different
  approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging
  obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to
  Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person
  and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel
  with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).

  Focus Tower is the center of the world and balances the forces of the world.
  However 4 monsters have taken the 4 elemental crystals (Earth, Water, Fire,
  Wind) for their own use, and also taken the 4 keys that for doors inside of
  Focus Tower. With the balance disrupted, disasters befall the world. A young boy
  by the name of Benjamin finds his home village destroyed. Meeting a mysterious

  prophesized hero and the only one who can save the world. Benjamin must recover
  the 4 crystals, unlock Focus Tower and defeat the ultimate monster before the
  5th crystal, the Crystal of Life is corrupted.
  .
  Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest is an RPG game, shown from an overhead view for
  movement within areas and using a 3rd person view for battles. The game is
  divided into "areas" on the world map between which the player can freely jump.
  These areas are divided into Towns, Dungeons and Battle Areas. Towns feature
  characters to interact and talk to, Dungeons are mazes filled with monsters and
  Battle Areas are instant battles with specific monsters, completion of which
  sometimes awards special items. Inside a Dungeon or Town, the player moves from
  an overhead view, with he ability to jump, use weapon at whatever is in front of
  the character, interact with NPCs and attack monsters.
  .
  Unlike other Final Fantasy games, there are no random battles, all the enemies
  are visible to the player (or in specific "Battle Areas").  During battle, the
  game features turn-based combat (but not the "ATB battle system" used in other
  Final Fantasy games) where the player chooses from battle commands such as
  Attack, Defend, Item and Spells.
  .
  Also unlike other Final Fantasy games, the player's party only ever consists of
  two characters: Benjamin and another character who can either by controlled
  manually or automatically by the AI. Benjamin can collect armor for 4 different
  parts of the body as well as 4 different kinds of weapons, however the other
  party member cannot have their equipment changed.
  .
  Players can save at any point in the game. If the player is defeated in a
  battle, the game will let the battle be retried, but any items used will be
  lost.

developer: Electronic Arts
publisher: Electronic Arts
description:
  European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a
  sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European
  pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much
  more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of
  advances in programming skill.
  .
  The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games,
  but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot,
  so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one
  exaggerating the effect.
  .
  As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total
  score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent),
  there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as
  possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.

  the country´s most fearsome cop and hunts his nemesis, Simon Phoenix. However in
  doing so, he kills several innocent civilians and both characters are sentenced
  to cryostasis rehabilitation where they will be brainwashed for 30 years.
  However the brainwashing does not go as planned and upon waking up, Phoenix goes
  on a new crime spree. However in 30 years the world has also changed and Los
  Angeles has become San Angeles, a utopian and violence-free society. As a
  remnant of a more violent past, police officer John Spartan is once again sent
  to capture Phoenix.
  .
  Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with some levels taking place in
  an overhead perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John Spartan, the player will
  spend most of his time shooting endless waves of "cryocons" released upon the
  antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a
  shotgun and magnum, both with limited ammo. Additionally, various types of
  grenades can be collected, which are thrown independently of the firearm. Simon
  Phoenix appears as a boss character at the end of every level that is directly
  tied in with the movie.

  This game comes at you with a Fantastic Voyage tale of a microsurgeon
  miniaturized to a near-microscopic scale in order to enter the body and save the
  life of a tobacco salesman, ironically laid low by health complications caused
  by the very cigarettes he sold.  Rex must be asking himself, "My parents put a
  mortgage on their house to put me through eight years of medical school just so
  I could scrub tar off someone's lungs like a window-washer?"  But it gets worse:
  Big Tobacco, pre-emptively attempting to silence the turnabout whistleblowing
  revelation they anticipate in the unlikely event of this salesman's recovery,
  have some shrinking technology of their own, and have introduced sinister
  nanobots into his body to ensure his -- and Rex's -- untimely demises.
  .
  Washing off goo and attempting to survive the robot sprites' poor
  collision-detection routines comprise the large part of this game (albeit in
  exotic, well-rendered environments such as The Mouth, The Heart, The Lungs, and
  eventually The Brain -- where you struggle to clean up regenerating blobs of
  nicotine addiction); sporadically you also encounter mines which grill you on
  smoking-related health facts and myths, rewarding correct answers and blowing up
  when presented with falsehoods.  Though the majority of the game plays like a 2D
  platform shooter, there are also over-the-shoulder 1st-person inter-level
  sequences where you pilot a futuristic vessel through bronchial tubes and blood
  vessels like something out of Space Harrier or Tempest -- only with more globs
  of diseased sputum zooming straight toward you.

developer: EA Sports
publisher: EA Sports
description:
  PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, and
  technologically the most advanced one. Instead of offering  several generic
  courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are
  in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of
  the console allow).
  .
  The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were
  digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive,
  driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match
  and Shootout), as well as a replay.
  .
  Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to
  start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's
  possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and
  pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a
  bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit
  areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in
  pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However,
  only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice
  levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.

description:
  Wario's Woods is a puzzle game similar to Tetris or Columns, but with a twist.
  Instead of directly controlling the monsters and bombs that are falling down,
  the player controls Toad who has to carry around stacks of monsters and bombs
  and to combine them in the right way. One bomb plus at least two monsters of the
  same color have to be combined to make them disappear. If five or more objects
  are cleared at the same time, a diamond will appear. Destroying the diamond will
  clear all monsters of the diamond's color.\n
  There are four different ways to pick up objects. The A button lets Toad pick up
  the whole stack that is in front of him, the B button lets him only pick up one
  object, even if it's in the middle of a stack, the Y button lets him kick a
  monster or bomb that's in front of him and the X button places him on top of the
  stack that he is carrying. He can also run up walls and stacks to catch falling
  objects out of the air or to pick up certain parts of a stack.
  .
  There are 5 different modes of play: a "Round Game" in which Toad has to clear
  numerous levels, a match versus a computer controlled opponent, a two player
  mode, a "Time Race" mode, and finally, an extensive training mode.
  .
  There are some differences between the SNES and NES versions. Due to a lack of
  buttons, controls are a little different in the NES version (although all the
  moves from the SNES version are present). Also, there is no vs. mode against the
  computer, but the "Round Game" mode features two modes of play: one that

  Out of This World is an action adventure game, where the adventuring element is

  interface, and no in-game dialogue. Each enemy requires a different strategy,

  defeated through the use of a gun you find near the beginning of the game; the
  gun can be used to create a shield from behind which you can safely fire.

developer: Spectrum Holobyte
publisher: Spectrum Holobyte
description:
  WildSnake is a puzzle game in which the player must manage falling snakes in a
  confined space and keep the snakes from reaching the top of the space. Snakes
  fall and slither until they reach a resting spot on the floor of the space. A
  snake will destroy any other snakes of the same color and pattern that it
  touches with its head on the way down, which often has the chain effect of
  loosening the pile of snakes so that all the snakes slither into new positions,
  possibly eliminating even more snakes.
  .
  The game is played against a selection of backgrounds including desert, forest,
  water, or grass. Further, there are 7 game grids including the standard grid (a
  tall rectangle), X, plus, flask, Diabolo (an hourglass pattern), T-square, and
  obstacle (with a number of intermediate blocks).
  .
  The player starts out as a nestling and earns higher and higher distinctions
  taken from the snake realm (garter snake, water snake, boa, mambo, python, king
  cobra, etc.) as more snakes are cleared. Also, as the level increases. more
  types of snake patterns must be handled. Sometimes, there is a flashing red
  snake that eliminates the first snake it touches. Further, there is occasionally
  an unstoppable snake that barrels down to the bottom of the space, eliminating
  all snakes in its path.
  .
  The game can be played with 1 or 2 players in either easy, normal or hard mode.
  In the single player mode, the player can choose whether the preview showing the
  next snake will be shown. In 2-player mode, there is always a preview window. In
  fact, there is a queue of 3 snakes between the 2 player spaces from which the
  next snake is drawn. As a bonus during competition, multiple snake eliminations
  by one player result in obstacles appearing in the space of the opposing player.

developer: Acclaim
publisher: Acclaim
description:
  This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the
  NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and
  deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories,
  from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.
  .
  Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player
  for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face
  each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player
  with a CPU team-mate.
  .
  The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for
  substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which
  lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover.
  Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes
  four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:
  .
  1. "Hot Spots" are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to
  a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.
  .
  Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when
  picked up. Some examples are instant "on-fire," enhanced 3-point accuracy,
  monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other
  players to the ground.
  .
  "Juice Mode" increases the speed of the game up to 4x.
  .
  "Tournament Mode" disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and
  challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra
  players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher
  CPU difficulty level.

  monorails, computers, and street gangs armed with automatic weapons co-exist
  with orcs, dwarves, and vampires, you begin to discover the mystery and to learn
  about the dangers awaiting you around every corner.

  Shadowrun for SNES is a skill-based RPG that uses real time combat. You can hire
  "deckers", i.e., temporary party members, but the main focus of the gameplay is
  on Jake and his abilities and skills. There are no random battles, but many
  screens with respawning enemies, where you can earn experience points and
  upgrade your skills. The experience points are called "karma" in this game. You
  need to gain karma in order to advance in one of the several skills available to
  you. You'll also be able to buy skills from people. The skills include firearms,
  computers, negotiation, leadership, and many others. You can also use the gained
  karma points to upgrade basic stats like hit points or charisma.

  Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives

  the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.

  You have been called by the Master to restore life to the Friel empire.  The
  ruler, King Magridd, struck a deal with the evil Deathtoll - in exchange for the
  soul of one living being, Deathtoll will give him a piece of gold.  Magridd's
  greed got the better of him, and, thinking of the millions of souls of every
  living creature around the world, readily agreed to the deal.  But Magridd
  himself has since disappeared, and the the land is now devoid of life - instead
  only filled with Deathtoll's monstrous minions.  Will you be able to save
  Friel's subjects from their horrible fate?
  .
  Soul Blazer is an action RPG in the top-down style of The Legend of Zelda.  Like
  Zelda, battles are not turn-based - the player directly attacks enemies and
  dodges them.  As they progress, they also unlock special items which allows them
  to complete tasks for characters or access special areas (such as the Dream Rod,
  which transports you into someone's - or something's - dream).  Unlike Zelda,
  the game has an experience meter, and the player levels up and becomes stronger
  as they defeat enemies.  The game's unique hook is that there are "Monster
  Lairs" spread all over the land of Friel.  When they destroy all the enemies in
  a lair, they don't come back, and when they step on the empty lair, it restores
  part of the game world, bringing back anything from plants, to animals, to
  people, to buildings and more.  Each restored soul helps in some way - for
  example, the player can climb regrown ivy to reach new areas, reunite families
  by bringing back husband and wife, rebuild cities by restoring architects, and
  talk to characters to complete even more quests.
  .
  The player's main goal is to find six Stones, which allow them to gain access to
  the World of Evil, where Deathtoll resides.  These stones are guarded by key
  characters in different parts of the world, usually the rulers, who require the
  player to defeat a boss character to rescue them.  While most of the game allows
  them to progress in a linear fashion, there are certain souls that can only be
  restored by killing monsters that can't be harmed with their earlier weapons.
  The player will need to find special weaponry and then backtrack to previous
  areas to rescue these souls.  It's also advisable to revisit previous locations,
  as certain characters may have new sidequests to complete which can reward them
  with new items to make them even stronger.

  wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to
  their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually
  choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.
  .
  There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with
  throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult,
  involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam
  from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack
  crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other
  to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually
  done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.
  .
  Each level has a certain "save limit", meaning you have to save at least a
  certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and
  lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the
  compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers
  will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of
  time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some
  assistance.
  .
  At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that
  you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress
  through them all from the get-go.

description:
  Dr. Wily, angered at being foiled once again decides to send his robots to the
  soccer field. Dr. Light immediately responds by forming a soccer team of Mega
  Mans to counter Dr. Wily's latest scheme.
  .
  Mega Man Soccer is an overhead view soccer game featuring characters from the
  Mega Man series. Players begin by selecting either Exhibition, Tournament,
  League or Capcom Championship modes. Depending on the mode, a team must be
  formed using either all of one type of robot, or a mixture of different types
  assigned to different positions on the field. In any case, each soccer team has
  8 players on the field including the goalie. The goal of each team is to score
  on the net of the opposing team, earning points to win the game. The action
  follows the ball as it is tossed around the field from player to player. Once a
  player's team member has the ball they can choose to pass it to another
  teammate, shoot the ball straight ahead or perform a clearing kick (if the
  goalie). If the player does not have the ball, they are given control of the
  nearest player to the ball and can slide tackles or shoulder tackles to try to
  gain possession. Each type of robot has a special move that can be initiated.

game: Jurassic Park

developer: Ocean
publisher: Ocean
description:
  The SNES game based on the film Jurassic Park is an action title that combines
  top-down and first-person perspectives.
  .
  Playing as Dr. Alan Grant, the player's ultimate goal is to escape the Jurassic
  Park island. To reach that goal, several other tasks must be completed,
  including restoring power to the park and destroying a Velociraptor nest.
  .
  The large game world is seen from a top-down view and can be freely explored.
  Some areas are not accessible from the beginning, however. To enter them,
  keycards must be found or some special goal be completed, like rebooting the
  computer system and using it to open certain gates. Dr. Grant can defend himself
  against the many free-roaming dinosaurs with a variety of weapons, including an
  electroshock gun, a shotgun, rocket launcher, gas grenade launcher and bola gun.
  All weapons except the electro gun require ammo to work. A radar at the bottom
  of the screen helps in detecting approaching dinosaurs, but will only work once
  the park's motion detectors have been activated.
  .
  Upon entering one of the park's buildings, the game view switches to a scrolling
  first person perspective, reminiscent of early first person shooters like
  Wolfenstein 3D. Just like outside, dinosaurs lurk in the corridors, and the same
  guns as in the overworld map can be used to destroy them. Many buildings consist
  of several floors, with elevators connecting them. Some rooms are pitch black
  and can only be entered when in possession of night vision goggles.
  .
  The game supports the SNES mouse for the first-person sections and the computer
  system interface.

  The original Street Fighter II is a famous fighting game. Players select from
  one of eight characters: Ryu, Ken, Blanka, E. Honda, Zangief, Chun Li, Guile and
  Dhalsim to do battle with. They must then use their combat strengths to defeat
  the other seven fighters followed by four boss characters: M. Bison, Vega, Sagat
  and Balrog. Each character represents a certain country and has their own
  reasons for wanting to win against the others.
  .
  Each character contains his own selection of basic fighting techniques based on
  three styles of punches and three styles of kicks. The effect of each of these
  changes depending on the characters orientation (ducking, airborne or standing
  still). Street Fighter 2 made famous the "button combination" style of gameplay
  used to unleash powerful moves specific to each character. These include the
  ability to project fireballs, channel electricity or capture the opponent in a
  tight suplex.
  .
  Street Fighter 2 is one of the most cloned fighting games and its effects on
  gameplay and fighting games specifically can not be understated. Street Fighter

  1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the
  most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been
  all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly
  normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were
  looking to revive the great force once known as "magic".
  .
  But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...
  .
  The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an
  "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were
  dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers,
  a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most
  dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a
  rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones
  that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.
  .
  The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous
  Final Fantasy games, spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a real-time
  element. The customization system combines character-specific classes with
  free-flowing character development. By finding various Espers and equipping them
  on characters, you can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the
  magic spells you want to learn for each character.

  establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes
  (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no
  offsides).

  The story of this game is based on Episode IV: A New Hope, the first of the
  original  Star Wars movie trilogy. The player initially controls the movie's
  main hero, Luke Skywalker, but two more controllable characters join later: the
  careless captain Han Solo and his Wookie side-kick, Chewbacca. The game
  generally follows the movie plot, allowing the player to experience some of the
  most important sequences, such as the search for Obi-Wan Kenobi, rescuing
  princess Leia, and the final confrontation against Death Star and its TIE
  Fighters, led by the mysterious Darth Vader.
  .
  Most of the game levels follow traditional platform gameplay style. As Luke,
  Han, or Chewbacca, the player makes his way through the linear levels, fighting
  enemies, jumping over obstacles, and collecting power-ups. The power-ups include
  standard health-restoring items, upgrades for the blaster gun (up to five
  different upgrade levels), as well as special items that can be used for massive
  destruction of the enemies. Luke uses a weak blaster gun, but later gains access
  to a lightsaber, being able to fight enemies melee-style. Han and Chewbacca use
  stronger flame guns, but cannot upgrade to better weapons.
  .
  Some of the levels are dedicated to familiar Star Wars vehicles (such as a land
  speeder). Controlling the vehicle from a third-person view, the player has to
  navigate it through the pseudo-3D environments, avoiding obstacles and shooting
  at enemies on the way.

description:
  Borf has kidnapped Dexter's girlfriend Kimberly and is threatening to turn
  earth's population into babies using his "Infanto Ray". Naturally, Dexter cannot
  let this happen and sets out to stop Borf and rescue Kimberly.
  .
  While following the same story as the Laserdisc conversions, the SNES version of
  Space Ace obviously lacks the long video sequences of the original, and also
  features different gameplay.
  .
  Instead of only pushing the right button at the right moment, the player has
  complete control over Dexter. Most of the time, he will be busy jumping over
  chasms and dodging alien attacks, but occasionally, an 'energize'-symbol will
  appear which, by pressing the correct button in time, will temporarily transform
  Dexter into his stronger alter ego and enable him to shoot at his enemies.
  .
  Once he boards his space ship, Dexter has to find his way out of a labyrinthine
  seen from a top-down perspective, destroying obstacles with the ship's laser and
  avoiding collisions.
  .
  In order to retain the atmosphere of the original, the SNES version features a
  large number of (short) death animations and the platformer levels always follow
  the exact same sequence, which results in a trial&error-style gameplay somewhat
  similar to the original.

game: Sid Meier's Civilization
file: Sid Meier's Civilization.zip
developer: Koei
publisher: Koei
description:
  Civilization has the widest scope of any strategy game of its time. You are a
  leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the
  XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual
  goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out
  everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.
  .
  As the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build
  cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of
  people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food
  (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build
  military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money,
  science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much
  trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that
  your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse
  into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation.
  .
  If you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions,
  such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only
  one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you
  complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will
  eventually stop working.
  .
  There are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll
  have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you
  can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific
  knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but
  eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military
  units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly
  taking over them).
  .
  Not all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create
  roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities,
  increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with
  the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to
  join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can
  be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can
  also help in building Wonders of the World.
  .
  Scientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your
  cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be
  finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the
  game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you
  some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting
  effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your
  citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too
  much of it, global warming may occur.
  .
  How your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your
  nation has. Initially you're living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of
  your civilization, so it's a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy,
  Republic, Democracy or Communism.

  In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the

  different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three
  Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a

  rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and
  IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game.
  The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes
  increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.
  .
  During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands
  from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying
  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe

  bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them

  action is split into four worlds.  In each of the first three worlds, the
  Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion can be found, while in the last rather than gain a
  companion the witch must be fought.  After gaining a companion, the characters
  may be switched on the fly, and each companion has significantly different
  attacks and abilities.  Several of the levels require using a combination of all
  of these abilities to fully explore. The game also includes a variety of
  mini-games which gives the player a chance to play as Toto also.
  .
  All levels can be revisited once passed and doing so required both for the
  purposes of stocking up on items and to find the Emerald City tickets which are
  required to enter the final area.

description:
  The date is Tuesday, September 13th, 1921.  It's a stormy night, and the luxury
  ocean liner "Lady Crithania" is about to be capsized by an enormous wave.  Many
  of its crew and its 2300 passengers will be killed outright in the initial
  overturning; in the transfigured catastrophic ship environment, most of the
  remainder will be unable to locate, reach and secure a safe exit from the
  sinking ship before it floods entirely.  Will you?
  .
  Inspired by Paul Gallico's 1969 novel The Poseidon Adventure, this game puts the
  player in the shoes of one of four denizens of the fated vessel: Capris Wisher,
  architect; Redwin Gardener, counselor; Luke Haines, sailor; or Jeffrey Howell,
  doctor.  Each of these gentlemen possess certain exclusive skills and distinct
  backstories and motivations -- a successful strategy toward winning the game
  will vary greatly depending on which character you initially select to play.
  And just how is the game won?
  .
  Here's a hint: don't be on the ship when it goes down for the last time.
  Accomplishing this demands mastery of a new skill hitherto untapped by its
  platform-game spiritual predecessors Prince of Persia and Flashback: exploring
  and navigating the ship in both an upright and an upside-down position, as well
  as many of the gradiated permutations between -- thanks to dizzying Mode 7
  abuse, the game environment will tip, tilt and skew at predictable (and
  predictably inconvenient) intervals, granting access to some hitherto
  unreachable areas (those doors at floor level are of little use when you're on
  the ceiling!) while denying access to other portions of the ship you perhaps
  intended to go back through.  You're going to need to recognize where you can
  and can't -- yet -- reach, and make a note to revisit when the pendulum swings
  the other way.
  .
  You're not going to make it out on your own.  A successful evacuation is going
  to require the assistance of other survivors.  Supposing you can find ( -- and
  reach!) them, you're still going to have to safely lead them past obstacles and
  hazards (as the ship flip-flops on its way to Davy Jones' Locker)... and as with
  all NPCs, they're slower and less agile than you, necessitating plotting out the
  simplest, safest course possible (... given the circumstances.)  Which of the
  endings you conclude with will be determined by who you rescue and how many of
  them there are -- but I'm sure you'll have your hands full the first few dozen
  play-throughs just staying alive and trying to figure out how to get to where
  you're supposed to be going.
  .
  Did I mention there's a time limit of one measly hour?  For once, it's your
  friend; since your injury in this dangerous and unpredictable environment is so
  frequent and, indeed, inevitable, death has been replaced by a deduction of 5
  minutes from the time remaining -- but no matter how safe and dry a hidey-hole
  you manage to find, when the countdown reaches zero, it's game over.
  .
  Hope you packed a towel!

game: Spectre
file: Spectre.zip
developer: Cybersoft
publisher: Cybersoft
description:
  Spectre is a 3D shooter where the player drives a little red car/tank and blasts
  away enemies.  The gameplay is similar to Battlezone, and obviously inspired by
  it.
  .
  There is a selection of three tanks, each with three values (speed; armor; and
  firepower) balanced out to match its name: Tough Guy is heavy on armor, but slow
  and not very powerful; Speedy is fast, but low armor; and Balanced combines both
  strengths, but decreased. A fourth tank allows the player to design a custom
  variant.
  .
  Every level consists of a large plane filled with enemy tanks, several
  psychedelic walls with odd images that often flicker or warp resembling an acid
  trip, and tacky 3D models like windmills.  The object of each level is to either
  destroy all the enemy tanks in the level, or to collect all the flags. Every
  level has a certain theme to it, anything from plain green to a colorful
  blinking eye or images of sand dunes are to be found on the walls, windmills and
  flags throughout the level.
  .
  With every passing level, enemy tanks grow smarter and their rates of fire
  increases.  Also in later levels, new, smarter, more powerful enemy tanks join
  the skirmish. The player has a limited amount of ammo, but driving over ammo
  deposits replenishes a small amount of ammunition, as well as driving over
  shield deposits grants additional shields. The three different views (first,
  third, and top-down) allow the player to incorporate additional strategies into
  the battles.
  .
  The game boasts having supposedly an infinite amount of levels, though anything
  after level 80 is almost instant death.  A high score table is also included.
  .
  An additional note-worthy feature of this game is the multi-player mode. Up to
  eight players are supported over IPX, or NetBios (or two via modem or serial
  port). The network option offers three Cyberspace Scenarios: Arena -
  free-for-all battles, get one point for each opponent destroyed.\n
  Flag Rally - a match point given for collecting six flags, destroy someone to
  get any flags being carried.\n
  Base Raid - Akin to "capture the flag".  Two teams, two bases; get match point
  for destroying opponent base.\n
  The CD-ROM manual includes a "Cyberpunk story", to give background information
  on the game which consisted of a cyberjock named Hart who lived for the battles
  in the Arena.

  as possible while trying to beat the clock.
  .
  In Elastic Sports, the player is strapped onto a long bungee cord and is bounced
  around.  There are three events: Slam Dunk is a basketball game, Attack is
  lacrosse and Spiral where the objective is to throw a football through a hanging
  tire.
  .
  Action Sports is an obstacle course which someone would find at a boot camp and
  is divided into two events:  Basic Training involves poles, swinging ropes and
  punching bags and Tornado Run which adds water jets and moving platforms.
  Players can also pick up bonus items that will add time or replenish health and
  a chance at the bonus round.
  .
  The final event is the Aggro Crag which is a giant indoor mountain the player
  must climb while avoiding various obstacles such as confetti cannons, moving
  platforms and smoke vents.  The goal of this event is to navigate the mountain
  and activate five different sensors located on the mountain before being able to
  activate the last one at the very top of the mountain.
  .
  There is also an option for two friends to compete either head-to-head or
  alternating depending upon the event.  Elastic lets the players compete against
  each other on a split-screen while Action Sports and the Aggro Crag has to be

  These abilities include cream pies, time bombs, sticks of dynamite and other fun

  Players control either Goemon or his partner Ebisu-Maru (or both, in 2 player
  mode). They sequentially travel through adventure-type villages and
  side-scrolling jump and run action stages. In the overhead-view villages,
  enemies must be defeated in order to earn money and other items (which include a
  weapon-enhancing lucky cat and mystical scrolls). The player is able to attack
  with their primary weapon and jump. Throwing weapons can also be used, which
  consume money for each one thrown. Attacking innocent villagers will cause the
  player to lose money. Money can also be gained (or lost) by visiting one of the
  numerous mini games, often in houses: which include mazes, whack-a-mole, the
  lottery, dice, a 3D labyrinth and a game trivia quiz show. Other businesses such
  as shops, resturants, inns and judo training can also be visited.

  obstacles, traps, enemies and a boss creature. In addition to the regular moves
  used in town, players also gain the ability to unleash one of four special
  attacks for each character (if bought beforehand at the judo training center).
  These consume the scrolls collected in order to use. Additionally, in a 2 player

game: Pga Tour Golf
file: PGA Tour Golf.zip
developer: Electronic Arts
publisher: Electronic Arts
description:
  PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre
  since. The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second
  setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a
  multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing.
  .
  Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the
  programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and
  trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.
  .
  When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US
  golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.

  The First Annual Dream Land's Avalanche Competition is about to get under way,
  and as Kirby and a host of characters from the Kirby series, you can join the
  tournament and become Avalanche king.
  .
  Avalanche is similar to Puyo Puyo, and has you stacking colored blobs similar in
  a way to Tetris. When a certain amount of one color is stacked, an explosion
  occurs and the screen clears of those blobs, which then appear in the other
  players screen (either the CPU or a second player). When your screen is cleared
  before the other player, you move onto the next round, and so on until the final
  boss. The winner of that match is then crowned the Avalanche king.

game: Top Gear 2

developer: Kemco
publisher: Kemco
description:
  This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin's earlier Lotus series, in terms
  of its general look and feel, right down to the text font used in the game. Your
  task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with
  many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza
  layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver).
  .
  These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you
  race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the
  top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in
  thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires
  (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal
  approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when
  upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password.
  .
  You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus
  nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as
  puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.

game: Operation Thunderbolt

developer: Taito
publisher: Taito
description:
  Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is
  hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all
  hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching
  its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the
  hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero
  from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings
  his friend along for the ride.
  .
  There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has
  you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one
  or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat,
  while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited
  supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock
  up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that
  get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like
  bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.
  .
  You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if
  rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're
  energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of
  energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them
  if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the
  mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be
  difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of
  fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.
  .
  There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend
  on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot
  instead of the mission eight boss.

  and a mysterious pendant will thrust him into the ultimate trip through time and
  space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering
  the one who would destroy the flow of time.
  .
  Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for
  such: the player takes control of a variably large party, developing the combat
  skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters grow in
  power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs" -
  special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in
  battle.
  .
  The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy
  games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat -  adding to it combo
  attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple
  Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using
  their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the
  enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them
  entirely.
  .
  The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time,
  which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option,
  which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds
  even more endings to the already existing ones.

  Queensland, Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen
  or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are
  played in the race.\n
  A key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in
  the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must
  be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a

  should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after
  every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within
  your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a
  time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.
  .
  The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4
  points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car
  off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which
  involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level,
  although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared
  the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks
  are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system
  as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

  previously appeared in Rocket Knight Adventures. It is very different from the
  contemporary Genesis title Sparkster, as it does not continue the story from the
  first game and has completely different levels, enemies and gameplay mechanics.
  In that way it can be considered a spin-off in the series. The introduction
  merely shows how an elderly man captures a girl and takes her into his airship.
  At that point Sparkster appears and he decides to chase them.
  .
  Sparkster is a rodent carrying a rocket pack on his back. He can move around,
  duck, jump and hang from branches or rails. His regular attack is a sword slash
  that sends out a circular projectile. Through the L and R buttons he can dash
  left and right in a circle of fire. Keeping the attack button pressed powers up
  a rocket meter. When full, different types or actions can be performed: dashing
  left, right or up to cover a large distance, ricocheting off walls in a diagonal
  motion, or a stationary attack.
  .
  The game consists of nine levels of which the last two can only be accessed on
  higher difficulty levels. Sparkster collects diamonds for points, defeats all
  types of robot enemies and collects apples to restore his heart meter near the
  top of the screen. Most of the game consists of regular platforming gameplay,
  with a few diversions where Sparkster rides a robot bird, or is shown from a
  top-down view flying in the air like a vertically-scrolling shooter. All levels

  Maui.  Ninja Maui has lightning-quick reflexes, and wields a bo staff.  In

  walls by jumping and propping the staff between the walls at the height of his
  jump.  He can also hook onto duck heads and swing from them to reach areas he
  normally couldn't.  You'll need to constantly find Yin-Yang coins to fuel your
  Ninja persona, otherwise you'll run out and transform back to Maui Mallard.

  an icon to indicate location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in the
  aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively
  played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a
  very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played
  or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the
  possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the
  played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those
  changes.

  strange worlds. He travels throughout such landscapes as giant toy factories and
  arctic snowfields during his quest, facing down all manner of dangerous enemies
  and obstacles. He can jump and he can  launch a large fist from his stomach (he
  is a blob, after all). Further, different levels have special power-ups that
  allow the blob to assume different forms that are useful in specific
  circumstances. These include a hot air balloon (for floating up to special
  items), a hammer (for smashing obstructing blocks), a submarine (for more
  effectively navigating an undersea bonus level), a skateboard (for blazing
  through a level on a deadline), and a pogo stick (for extra high jumping). Not
  all of the power-ups are useful, though. One item turns Jelly Boy into a block
  so that he is unable to move for several seconds.
  .
  Jelly Boy collects musical notes in lieu of having a power meter. Being hit
  knocks away all of his collected notes and if he gets hit again without having
  any notes, he will lose a life. Jelly Boy also collects a variety of fruit
  throughout his quest. Accumulate enough fruit to earn extra lives. Certain types
  of fruit have other side effects (orange = more time on the clock, avocado =

description:
  First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet
  (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army).
  The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which
  can be completed in any other, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its
  own surprises.
  .
  Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use
  whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go
  to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can
  freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles.
  .
  Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for
  better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put
  protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser
  turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will
  build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.
  .
  Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to
  dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area
  you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll
  start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level
  up then the at previous level.
  .
  If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush
  the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what
  its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same
  level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy
  soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.
  .
  The main thing as it always is in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and
  lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your
  men, making a perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes...
  to dominate the world and crush your opponents.
  .
  You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your
  men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of
  age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.

  You're playing a small ant that is willing to help a friend in rather
  inconvenient situation. Apparently, your friend, doggie, likes to eat cookies
  that has his picture on their box, and he got himself so carried away that he
  lost the balance, and a bag of cookies fell deep down into an ant-hill. Now,
  you're goin' in, in a mission of solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for
  your friend.
  .
  Now, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from
  the one you live in. It's path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates,
  and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place
  inside, you'll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend
  doggie.
  .
  The main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in
  a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one
  that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently.
  Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you
  cannot practice that, so if you jusp from a little bit too high position, don't
  expect much, but to retry the level.
  .
  Every block, or boulder in a game has a different markings. Like for example,
  the yellow ones are bricks you can push, and they will just as easily fall, and
  push, or not, the brick in front of it. The red ones will do the opposite, you
  cannot push them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits it, it'll continue
  falling back to the other side. Some bricks explode when you push them, or other
  brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue
  spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, 'til they hit some other
  brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that
  place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not,
  the brick in front of them. Anyway, that's the game basics.
  .
  Each level gives you the new code/password, so you can continue from the
  position where you ended each time you type that code. Perspective of your ant
  is like in any other platform game, and you control it with arrow keys, or
  joystick. But beware, the time is clicking, so you'll have to solve each level
  in a hurry.

game: Outlander

developer: Mindscape
publisher: Mindscape
description:
  Mindscape developed this game hoping to get it licensed as an official Mad Max
  game, however Warner Bros never made this happen. Anyway, the game closely
  resembles "The Road Warrior" (Mad Max 2). Your objective is to drive your car
  through the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang members' attacks and to
  avoid running out of gas.
  .
  The gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and side-scrolling. In the racing
  parts you have to destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, gyro-copter
  captains, red trucks, etc. Your car has a machine-gun installed in its front,
  and if some guy drives along side of you, a little window pops up, allowing you
  to shoot them with your shotgun.
  .
  Along the road there are several towns, and every time you pass through one of
  them, an alarm will warn you. As your gas run low, you have to stop on these
  towns and refuel your reserves of gas and ammo. When doing so, the game turns to
  a side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your car, dealing with your
  enemies in hand-to-hand combats. In the cities you'll also find new equipment to
  your car, such as missile launchers, nitro, etc.

  actions and one for "Hyper Plays", special attacks that can only be learned and
  used in the Hyper League. How a player will block or attack depends on the
  ball's speed and the players position. Team members who aren't under the
  player's direct control will also act on their own by positioning themselves or
  preparing spikes. They will, however, not block spikes on their own but it is
  possible to let players not under direct control block spikes by pressing one of

  One day a spaceship came down from the heavens and into the skies of Chinaland.
  It began broadcasting an image of peace. Soon Emperor Chin was holding a peace
  conference with the space ship's leader, Rub-A-Doc. Rub-A-Doc visited with some
  of the other places in the world before departing to the heavens and leaving the
  world. All seemed peaceful however there seems to be trouble starting up,
  strange monsters have been seen throughout Chinaland. Could the increase in
  monsters be somehow related to the recent visit from Rub-A-Doc? The ninja
  masters of Mount Edin, Jack and Ryu are sent to investigate...
  .
  Super Ninja Boy is an action RPG for one or two players. In a two player game,
  each player controls either Jack or Ryu. In a one player game, only Jack
  appears.A second player may join at any time by visiting a convenience store.
  .
  As mentioned, this game is an RPG and contains familiar RPG elements such as
  equipping differing kinds of weapons, equipment and gaining levels. The Ninja
  Boys are treated as a single entity and so these statistics are shared between
  Jack and Ryu with equal values. Battles with the enemy, either through random
  encounters or visible on the map is where the action starts. The characters
  enter a side-scrolling 'battle mode' where they may jump, fight, use their
  special techniques, items and spells... as well as activate various 'bonuses' on
  the battlefield by breaking open the bonus boxes. A battle is over and
  experience points awarded when a pre-determined number of enemies are defeated
  or the Ninja Boys are defeated.
  .
  When bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each
  turn, commands are given to Jack & Ryu, which include usage of special items and
  skills accuired during the game, who then perform actions based on those
  commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one
  side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints.

  Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games
  held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the
  console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles,
  pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and
  archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics,
  or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events,
  and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow
  competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.
  .
  Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes
  compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two
  qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction
  can earn world record times.
  .
  Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely
  pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then
  set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests,
  three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex
  pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and
  good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round
  composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where
  they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition
  continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.
  .
  The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping
  events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed
  by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight
  allowed three more attempts.
  .
  Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the
  goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of
  the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to
  the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards
  and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed
  directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal
  is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for
  each.

game: On The Ball
file: On the Ball.zip
developer: Taito
publisher: Taito
description:
  There's a kind of knick-knack you may find in dusty games rooms, a maze through
  which you navigate a marble by subtly tilting the board, dancing with gravity
  and momentum, deftly rolling your sphere out of dead ends and around the
  obstacles posed by holes in the board. Marble Madness explores this theme in a
  fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly
  influencing the actions of the ball.  The game takes a different approach toward
  a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board
  around the ball.
  .
  That's right; from the get-go, gravity pulls ever down, down, down on your ball
  toward the bottom of your screen regardless of board orientation; the task of
  the player is to rotate the board now clockwise, now counter-clockwise, to
  further a timely and unobstructed path beneath the ball in its progress toward
  each level's goal before the timer ticks down to zero.  The game might as well
  have been named "inertia."  Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be
  engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved
  to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off
  like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing.  Some influence the
  ball's direction, and in addition to merely delaying the ball's progress,
  touching some impediments incurs an additional time penalty -- conversely, some
  blocks bestow time bonuses, if you can afford the ever-diminishing time needed
  to take the scenic detour and collect them.
  .
  It may seem like a transparent attempt to cobble together a game around a
  technical demo of the SNES' Mode 7 on-the-fly graphics-rotation capabilities,
  but Taito actually cooked up this kooky game interface two years earlier for an
  arcade release of this game.

  Widget navigates through various worlds as he travels to Earth, picking up 'W'
  coins - 100 earns him an extra life.  There are also special power ups in
  different categories - these allow Widget to transform into a variety of
  different creatures, each with their own different ranged attack.  As the player
  collects more power-ups of the same type (up to three), they change into more
  powerful creatures.  If the player gets hit while transformed, they change back
  to the previous creature.  If they get hit while as normal Widget, they lose a
  life.

  At the end of each world is a boss character.  These are larger enemies that
  require learning their basic pattern, avoiding their attacks, and then firing
  back with your own.  After defeating the boss, the player is graded based on how

description:
  Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms,
  aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit
  points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes,
  causing damage to everyone around.
  .
  Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from
  his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time
  limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses
  health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or
  offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player
  can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn
  ends.
  .
  There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is
  affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others
  include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and
  girders.
  .
  There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land
  and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the

  A classic platformer, this title allows the player to choose between Inquisitive
  Smurf and Smurfette (there are no differences between characters) and collect
  all 10 shards scattered on the playfield.  There is a larger emphasis on
  exploring the levels rather than killing enemies (no score is given for them),
  so they can be avoided in most occasions, but if the needs arise, be dealt with
  a kick or in Mario fashion by jumping over them. Some shards can only be
  obtained by jumping on an enemy, using the sprint jump or using the scenario
  (ropes, or vines). While large falls don't harm the Smurfs, improper contact
  with enemies does. Each 1-up has four hearts, and at the fifth contact a life is
  lost and the player must restart the level. Once all lives are lost, the game is
  over - there are no continues. To fill the meter there are hearts and small
  Smurf icons scattered or hidden somewhere in the level, and on all stages
  there's a key that unlocks a bonus level if all three are collected at the end
  of the continent. In these bonus levels the player collects as much objects as
  possible which translate into hearts when the time closes. If the player fills
  the meter, a 1-up is awarded.

  Based on MGM's world-known cartoon, the player controls Jerry, the Mouse (in
  2-Player Mode, P2 will control Jerry's nephew, Tuffy) as he explores four
  different worlds (movie theater, junkyard, a toy-based stage and the house
  inner). Game controls are simple: B Button makes Jerry/Tuffy to jump (tapping it
  again lightly upon landing will activate their Super Jumps), while A/Y/X Buttons
  will make them to throw marbles upward (Y Button) and downward (X/Y Buttons) in
  the enemies.
  .
  To earn extra lives throughout the game, players have two available options: the
  rarest and, sometimes, hardest way is to find a 1-Up icon; however, the easiest
  mode is to collect 100 of small balls of cheese scattered throughout the levels
  (Cheese Bits). Also, Jerry and Tuffy's health meters are displayed in the form
  of four hearts, that can be replenished through collectible larger cheese wedges
  (Cheese Chunks). At the end of each world, Jerry and Tuffy will take a
  confrontation with Tom, the Cat.

developer: Psygnosis

description:
  What do you get if you cross Sonic the Hedgehog with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater?
  .
  It might seem an odd combination, but it describes Uniracers perfectly. One of
  the more successful releases of the Super Nintendo's twilight era, Uniracers
  mixes platform-based high-speed racing, with crazy stunts and tricks.
  .
  The basic idea in most levels of the game is simple. Get your unicycle from A to
  B as quickly as possible, and finish ahead of your opponent. It's like Sonic,
  but with none of those pesky enemies, pointless power-ups and frustrating
  obstructions. In fact it doesn't sound like much of a game at all...
  .
  Here's the key, though. Tricks performed and landed during the race increase
  your speed. The better the trick, the greater your increase in speed will be.
  .
  Also, some levels are set in areas designed solely for stunts. Such levels
  require you to earn as many style points as possible, by doing tricks. These
  levels are against the clock, and a set points score, rather than an opponent.
  .
  Unicycles are stupid and difficult, and yet fun, once you get the hang of them.
  Much the same could be said about Uniracers...

  the cast meter and a pressing it again when the meter is set at a certain limit
  to cast it.
  .
  While fishing, the player will have an overhead top-down mode of the lake, using
  the "A" button to reel in their lure and using the D-Pad to manipulate movement
  of the lure.  Fish can be seen through the water, outlined in a light color
  while bigger fish are seen stationary and cast in a dark shadow.  Once the
  player hooks the fish, a meter will show up at the bottom, showing the tension
  of the line, when it hits to the far right of the meter, the line will snap.
  The line can also be manually cut by pressing the "A+B" buttons together.

  Xardion tells the tale of 3 warring planets that are home to 3 distinct alien
  races. Their fighting is interrupted by the threat of invasion from a much more
  potent alien race. The 3 planets find that they are able to set aside their
  differences long enough to battle their shared menace.
  .
  Each planet sends a warrior to deal with the threat. There is a robot named
  Triton, a cat-like quadruped named Panthera, and a giant red bipedal insect
  alien name Alcedes. The single player of the game controls one of these
  characters at a time and can switch at any time. If the current character loses
  all of his health, the player is sent back to the start of the level and that
  one character receives a health refill.
  .
  Each character has special attributes that help the team. For example,
  Panthera's relatively small size allows him to squeeze into spots where the
  other 2 characters can not travel. The characters can gather a number of unique
  powerups and weapons to help them on their mission.

description:
  Based off of the Jean Claude Van Damme film Timecop, this game acts as a sequel
  of sorts. We learned well from the film that the power time travel affords
  corrupts all men weaker than the Muscles from Brussels, and this has extended to
  the original inventor of time travel. He proclaims himself dictator of the
  universe, captures Van Damme as he arrives from fixing all the wrongs in the
  film, and challenges him to a "duel across time." Platforming action follows
  across multiple periods of history.
  .
  The primary feature of this game is its digitized characters, uncommon for
  console games of that era. Actors were taped in front of a bluescreen and stills
  were taken from the video to create all characters and their animations. The
  effect is impressive for the SNES, though it does result in robotic enemies who
  do not respond well to being punched or kicked. The "timing,", both in terms of
  controlling your character and fighting with enemy characters seems off through
  the entire game.
  .
  There are 15 levels in total, most of which are standard fighting platform
  levels. Three basic fighting moves are available to the character, not including
  jumping and crouching kicks, and not including the use of a gun with extremely
  limited ammo. Some vehicle levels are mixed in, and the game culminates in a
  jetpack duel over Los Angeles with the villainous time travel creator fellow.

  objects and fighting any enemies that get in your way, including the numerous
  bosses. If your in a tight spot you can\n
  call Arthur to help defeat any enemies that are on-screen. The game is presented
  in a normal 2D platformer view when you're just jumping from building to
  building, but changes to a semi-isometric view when you start fighting. You'll
  probably like it if you like Streets of Rage.

  of moles appear on the screen with a flag indicating the amount that need to be
  destroyed that level, before jumping into a pipe. From there the moles will
  climb out of any one of 12 holes on the screen and the player must shoot them as
  fast as possible. Along with regular moles are pink moles that will temporarily

  1. Type A: Intercept is a first person shooting game where the player shoots
  down incoming missiles and airplanes. These missiles/planes appear on the right
  side of the screen and move towards the left side. A radar is also given to the

  Ammunition is limited and the player must shoot down a certain amount each
  level.\n
  4. Type B: Engage is a first person shooting game where the player shoots down
  incoming missiles and airplanes, which will cautiously open fire on the player.

  of these objects on the screen. Ammunition is limited and the player must shoot
  down a certain amount each level.\n
  5. Type C: Confront is a first person shooting game where the player shoots down
  incoming spacecraft, which will actively open fire on the player. These UFOs can

  Based on the popular Where's Waldo series of books, the player's goal is to find
  Waldo, who is hidden in various pictures, before the time on the clock runs out.
  The player controls a magnifying glass and must click on various items for
  different effects. Finding a clock adds more time to the search, clicking on a
  150 icon adds 150 points to the score, etc.
  .
  Each picture consists of 6 adjacent screens containing a continuous theme. The
  themes are The Carpet Flyers, The Underground Hunters, The Battling Monks, The
  Unfriendly Giants and The Land of Waldos. Players are given the option of
  playing on Normal difficulty, Expert difficulty, or playing the Land of Waldos
  stage. The only difference between the difficulties is that on expert there are
  no clock items to provide players with extra time.
  .
  In all of the stages the player must find both Waldo and a scroll to complete
  the stage. Waldo must be found before the scroll in order to complete the stage.
  Waldo's dog Woof is also in each of these stages (except for the Land of Waldos)

  The sequel to one of the most famous games ever now has a much more significant
  plot. The Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their
  own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus
  and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10
  levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman
  from the 12 pieces.
  .
  Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in
  use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is
  perhaps the best option for first-time players.
  .
  The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards)
  and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to
  produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various
  methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who
  can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their
  exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any
  combination of skills and experiment.
  .
  Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible,
  rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60
  Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe -
  Silver and Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back over levels in the
  hope of saving more Lems.
  .
  Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch between them at any point, you
  have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves your
  progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.

  resized or disabled. The method of triggering aftertouch onto a pass can be
  chosen as well.
  .
  The game features a variety of tournaments, including the full World Cup and its
  qualifying rounds, and the European Championships, or individual matches, as
  well as being able to configure a league or cup tournament ot your own
  specification. Only international teams are included, although their names can
  be customised. Unlike most soccer games of the time, player ethnicities are

  side of an opening in order for him to pass through. Droplets of water falling
  from above can change this number by performing an operation on it. There are
  also gems which can be collected for bonus points, and in higher levels,
  monsters appear that can knock Math Blaster down.

  4. Math Blaster - The Trash Alien's spaceship displays an equation, and the four
  portholes serve as multiple-choice answers. Use the jet pack to fly into the
  correct portholes while avoiding floating trash and energy blasts from the ship.

  Master Higgins finally marries his lovely girlfriend Tina. But out of nowhere, a
  powerful tropical cyclone destroyed the idyllic mood of their honeymoon. And not
  only this: it separated the ardent lovers again. After the winds stopped

  his brand new wife, got an assignment to save also a princess, whom the king was
  about to marry. Is there a connection between those two events?..

  distinguish the game clearly not only from ordinary platformers, but also from
  the first Super Adventure Island, are its light role-playing and puzzle-solving
  flavors. You don't have a time limit, but huge levels with many secret
  sub-levels to find, puzzles to solve, and treasure chests to unlock. You also
  can have equipment, such as swords, shields, etc. By defeating enemies, you gain
  health items, money, etc. Your HP is measured by hearts, and it can increase
  during the game if you find appropriate items. You also encounter random enemies
  while traveling on a world map.

  Camelot have been encased inside glass by Morgana Le Faye. Only the Spell of
  Spells would be able to free them. Merlin, knowing that the world would come to
  ruin without King Arthur uses his magic to search all of space and time for
  replacements. Finding the New York Knights football team and their quarterback,
  Arthur King, Merlin transports them back to Camelot and gives them magical
  armor. Transformed into; Sir Arthur, Sir Breeze, Sir Brick, Sir Darren, Sir
  Gallop, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lug, Sir Phil, Sir Tone, Sir Trunk, Sir Wally and Sir
  Zeke,  they must rescue the real Knights of the Round Table. In order to do so,
  the Arthur must recover the 12 keys of truth from Morgana's lieutenants each of
  which can only by touched by a specific knight. However in order to be able to
  defeat them, Arthur must first recover Excalibur and overcome other tasks.
  .
  King Arthur & the Knights of Justice is a top-down action game. It might be
  mistaken for an RPG, however the abilities of characters do not change over the
  course of the game. Players control Arthur King and can recruit two additional
  party members from the knights. Each knight has his own statistics in various
  areas including: Life Force, Defense, Strength and Speed. These party members
  are computer controlled with their own energy bars. Arthur can move up, down,
  left and right, block with his shield and parry with his shield. Arthur can
  swing his sword at any time but the damage inflicted depends on how much
  strength bar he has. The strength bar replenishes itself naturally over time,
  but is depleted every time Arthur swings his sword. Each knight including Arthur
  has a health bar, when this bar runs out, the knight is defeated. It can be
  restored by returning to Camelot or using items such as healing herbs. Arthur
  can carry a variety of different items accessible from the menu. Other menu
  functions include looking at the map, changing preferences and reviewing the
  statistics of the knights.

  Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint. The
  controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving
  the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down
  directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the
  paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types
  of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the
  door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything
  you’d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may
  be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy –this reduces the
  significance of the points system.

  A long time ago the kingdoms of wind, fire, earth and water\n

  to overthrow the united world. Now, only the kingdom of wind remains and the
  player takes control over the last Firestriker to free the other kingdoms and
  defeat the monsters.
  .
  Even though Firestriker looks like a typical SNES RPG, it is in fact an action
  game that has more in common with a pinball-game than with any other genre. The
  Trialight is a ball of fire that basically behaves like a pinball. The player
  controls the Firestriker who can freely walk across the screen and strike at the
  Trialight to control its movement. Levels are filled with obstacles, destroyable
  block and monsters. Monsters and blocks can only be destroyed by the Trialight.
  The goal of each level is to maneuver the Trialight towards the exit of the
  screen. The exit is usually blocked by destroyable obstacles and sometimes
  certain conditions (such as killing all monsters or destroying certain objects)
  have to be fulfilled before a level can be completed. If the Firestriker is
  killed or the Trialight falls off the screen, the player loses a life.
  Additionally to the Firestriker, the player can use the shoulder buttons to
  control a magician who (in single player mode) stays at the bottom of the
  screen. The levels consist of several screens and are entered from a world map.
  As the game progresses, the player will also fight several bosses and free other
  Firestrikers whose special abilities are necessary to complete the game.

game: Doom
file: Doom.zip
developer: Ocean
publisher: Ocean
description:
  The Union Aerospace Corporation has been experimenting with teleportation
  technology on Mars' moons Phobos and Deimos. After early successes, something
  goes wrong. It seems the scientists have opened a gateway straight to Hell.
  Phobos base is overrun with demonic creatures, and the whole of Deimos simply
  vanishes. A squad of marines is sent to Phobos, but all except one are quickly
  slaughtered. It falls to the surviving marine to grab some guns and strike back
  at the demons.
  .
  id Software's follow-up to their genre-defining Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM is another
  first person shooter: full-on action seen from the space marine's perspective.
  Like Wolfenstein, the game consists of distinct episodes, playable in any order.
  The first episode, Knee-Deep in the Dead, takes place in the Phobos base and is
  freely available as shareware. The full game continues on Deimos in The Shores
  of Hell and culminates in Inferno, the final episode which takes place in Hell
  itself. Each episode consists of nine levels, one of which is a hidden level.
  .
  The basic objective in each level is simply to reach the exit. Since dozens of
  enemies stand in the way, the only way to get there is through killing them.
  Switches and buttons must be\n
  pressed to advance at certain points and often color-coded locked doors will
  block the way - matching keycards or skull keys must be found to pass.
  .
  DOOM's engine technology is more advanced than Wolfenstein's, and thus the
  levels are more varied and complex. The engine simulates different heights
  (stairs and lifts appear frequently) and different lighting conditions (some
  rooms are pitch black, others only barely illuminated). There are outdoor areas,
  pools of radioactive waste that hurt the player, ceilings that come down and
  crush him, and unlike Wolfenstein's orthogonally aligned corridors, the walls in
  DOOM can be in any angle to each other. An automap helps in navigating the
  levels.
  .
  Stylistically, the levels begin with a futuristic theme in the military base on
  Phobos and gradually change to a hellish environment, complete with satanic
  symbols (pentagrams, upside-down-crosses and portraits of horned demons),
  hung-up mutilated corpses and the distorted faces of the damned.
  .
  DOOM features a large weapon arsenal, with most weapons having both advantages
  and drawbacks. The starting weapons are the fists and a simple pistol. Also
  available are a shotgun (high damage, slow reload, not good at distances), a
  chaingun (high firing rate, but slightly inaccurate in longer bursts) and a
  plasma rifle (combining a high firing rate and large damage). The rocket
  launcher also deals out lots of damage, but the explosion causes blast damage
  and must be used with care in confined areas or it might prove deadly to the
  player as well as the enemies. Two further (in)famous weapons in DOOM are the
  chainsaw for close-quarter carnage, and the BFG9000 energy gun, that, while
  taking some practice to fire correctly, can destroy most enemies in a single
  burst. The different weapons use four different ammunition types (bullets,
  shells, rockets and energy cells), so collecting the right type for a certain
  gun is important.
  .
  DOOM drops some of Wolfenstein's arcade-inspired aspects, so there are no extra
  lives or treasures to be collected for points, but many other powerups are still
  available. Medpacks heal damage while armor protects from receiving it in the
  first place. Backpacks allow more ammunition to be carried, a computer map
  reveals the whole layout of the level on the automap (including any secret
  areas), light amplification visors illuminate dark areas and radiation suits
  allow travel over waste without taking damage. Also available are berserk packs
  (which radically increase the damage inflicted by the fists) as well as
  short-time invisibility and invulnerability powerups.
  .
  The enemies to be destroyed include former humans corrupted during the invasion,
  plus demons in all shapes and sizes: fireball-throwing imps, floating skulls,
  pink-skinned demons with powerful bite attacks and large one-eyed flying
  monstrosities called Cacodemons. Each episode ends with a boss battle against
  one or two especially powerful creatures.
  .
  DOOM popularized multiplayer in the genre with two different modes: Cooperative
  allows up to four players to move through the single-player game together, while
  Deathmatch is a competitive game type where players blast at each other to
  collect 'frag' points for a kill and re-spawn in\n
  a random location after being killed.

  a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and
  others. There are also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers,
  snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses, including Very Gnawty,
  Necky, Bumble B, and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special
  blend of villainy.
  .
  Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong: these two primates differ significantly.
  For example, Donkey Kong is generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with
  a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to throw them farther.
  On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run
  really fast and do cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a
  shield against frontal attacks.
  .
  The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels.
  Each level contains bonus areas, where one can collect bananas, medallions, and
  lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a larger version of
  a minor enemy.

description:
  The Romulans request permission to enter the Neutral Zone in order to search for
  a team of their researchers that they claim has gone missing. The USS Enterprise
  is sent to monitor their activities and find out their real motives.
  .
  Gameplay is divided into three parts: commanding the Enterprise from the bridge,
  controlling an away team on a planetary mission and combat with other ships.
  .
  From the bridge you can control all of the ships main functions. Conn: Set
  course to a different planet or sector. Communication:  Communicate: with other
  ships. Sensors: Receive information on your surroundings or planets you are
  orbiting. Computer: Access a database that contains lots of information on
  planets, races, technology, your crew etc. Engineering: If the Enterprise got
  damaged during combat, you can use this command to allocate resources to the
  different parts of the ship that need to be repaired. Briefing Room: Receive
  orders and information on your current mission. Tactical Station: Engage in
  combat. Transporter: Assemble an away team and beam it down to a planet (which
  is only possible if your current mission requires it).
  .
  Before starting an away mission, you have to assemble a team of four crew
  members that differ in strength and in tactical and technical ability. Some crew
  members also have special abilities, Dr. Crusher can heal other crew members,
  Geordi and Data can see in the dark and Data can survive without air. Away
  missions are shown from a top-down perspective and you can control each team
  member individually or order different members to follow your currently selected
  character around. Most away missions are a mixture of simple (real time) combat
  and puzzle solving that usually consists getting hints from tricorder readings
  and finding objects that have to be used in the correct way.
  .
  Ship battles are also seen from a top-down perspective and let you attack enemy
  ships with phasers and photon torpedoes, while keeping an eye or your shields
  and trying to dodge you enemy's torpedoes. If your ship too heavily damaged you
  can surrender and hope that your enemy spares you.
  .
  While the SNES and Genesis versions are essentially the same games, there are
  some noticeable differences. The Genesis version plays considerably faster
  during ship battles and on away missions as well as on the bridge (meaning it
  takes much less time to repair the ship). There are many graphical differences
  and the map layout for away missions is slightly different from the SNES version
  as well.

  As he rushes out of bed and up to a nearby hill, he encounters a strange meteor,
  carrying a single passenger: a mysterious insect-like being named Buzz Buzz.
  Buzz Buzz tells him that in the future, an evil alien being known as Giygas has
  conquered the world, and the only one who can stop him are 4 young kids: 3 boys
  and a girl. Ness, of course, is one of the chosen ones... Ness now must find the
  other three children: Paula, a young girl with remarkable psychic powers, Jeff,
  a mechanical genius, and Poo, the young Prince of Dahlaam. Together, these four
  friends have the power to defeat Giygas and save the world from his chaotic
  reign!
  .
  EarthBound is a top-down RPG where you travel around Eagleland and various
  other, exotic countries, trying to end Giygas' evil influence.
  .
  On the way, Ness and his friends will encounter a lot of enemies and battle them
  in turn-based combat. Each turn, each of the characters in the party can attack
  with their weapon, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic
  powers that can hurt enemies, heal comrades and more; some also have some other,
  unique special powers), use an item or try and escape. The game features
  "rolling HP meters" - when a character is dealt damage, it's not all taken away
  from his HP right away, but instead his HP decreases slowly; if the combat is
  ended quickly, even a massively damaging attack can leave a character with only
  minor injuries. By winning battles, characters receive experience and thus
  become stronger.
  .
  If your characters are strong enough, weak enemies will escape from them instead
  of trying to attack them, and when chased down, they will be defeated instantly!
  .
  Saving the game is done by finding a telephone and calling Ness' father. When
  you defeat enemies, your bank account receives money which can be then retrieved
  from ATM machines throughout the game and spent in shops to buy better equipment
  or useful items.

description:
  The Dalai Llama (bad pun or what?) has organised a martial arts contest for
  animals of all species to prove their skills, and you are competing in it. There
  are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama
  himself.
  .
  Brutal: Paws of Fury is a standard one-on-one beat 'em up across a variety of
  levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters.
  Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama's island,
  fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown.
  .
  During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks
  on him/her, or use a "taunt" that restores a bit of your health. Each battle
  lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu);
  once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If
  the computer-controlled player won, it's game over (but you can still use a
  continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent.
  Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different
  depending on the character you have chosen.
  .
  Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the
  opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled
  opponent or another human player.
  .
  The visuals are leant towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of
  Mortal Kombat and the metal of Rise of the Robots.
  .
  In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new
  one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this
  feature, though.

description:
  The pirate Sküljagger and his crew hold the island of Westica hostage. Forcing
  the people who live there to be his slaves, Sküljagger rules unopposed with an
  iron fist. A brave sailor named Storm\n
  Jaxon decides to rebel and steal Sküljagger's magical sword. Now he must fight
  for his life and ultimately to free the Westican people.
  .
  Sküljagger: Revolt of the Westicans is a sidescrolling platform game. Players
  select between a 1 player game, an alternating turn 2 player game or Bubblegum
  Practice. The player controls Storm Jaxon who is able to run left and right,
  jump and swing Sküljagger's magic sword. Storm must reach the end of each level
  before time runs out or risk losing a life. Under normal circumstances, touching
  an enemy or projectile will cause him to die, though the sword is often able to
  destroy projectiles. By collecting red jewels, Storm is able to both augment the
  sword with a projectile attack and be protected from one enemy attack. Green
  jewels will also protect from one enemy attack, however collecting 25 of them
  will grant an extra life. Blue jewels add additional time for Storm to complete
  each level. Finding a mask will make Storm invulnerable for a short time. These
  power-ups are either floating in the air of each level or hidden away in chests,
  boxes, rocks and coconuts. However these items which may hide items can also be
  picked up and thrown at enemies.
  .
  In addition to the power-ups listed above, fruity bubblegum can also be found.
  Only one bubble gum flavor can be carried at a time and it will be held until
  the player activates it. Grape bubblegum encases Storm in a giant invulnerable
  bubble that can bounce higher than jumping alone. Cherry bubblegum will require
  the player to inflate manually, but will allow Storm to fly. Beware as over
  inflating the bubble will pop it. Watermelon bubblegum will turn Storm into a
  projectile that damages anything on the screen, also gathering items. Orange
  bubblegum will let Storm spit out pellets at enemies which will destroy them.
  Bubblegum power-ups can be tested in the special bubblegum practice option of
  the menu.

game: Pac-attack

developer: Namco
publisher: Namco
description:
  Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack
  is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.
  .
  The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which
  can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as
  possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at
  random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you
  place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area,
  he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of
  blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a
  meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear
  approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although
  the blocks that were on top of them will drop.
  .
  Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human
  player. It's similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of
  ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.
  .
  The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have
  to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in
  certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction
  with the press of a button.
  .
  All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the
  versus mode.

description:
  The Adventures of Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun is based on the Belgian comic
  book of the same name. The basic plotline is the same: Professor Cuthbert
  Calculus gets kidnapped and the player, in the role of Tintin, needs to rescue
  him. The rest is more loosely adapted: in contrast to the comic, which is mostly
  based in Peru, this game offers many different locations all over the world.
  .
  The gameplay itself is a typical platforming action: Tintin walks through the
  levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and
  security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself.
  This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their
  patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit.
  Required for success is the usage of the two playing plains: from the player's
  perspective in the foreground and further towards the background. Tintin can
  switch between the two at any time.

  Special gadgets to be used include the famous Batarang to take out enemies from
  a distance and "Test Tubes" filled with chemical explosives which will damage
  all enemies on the screen.

  In the second type of side-scrolling level, Batman can only move in one
  dimension, left or right. The Batarang is the standard weapon here, with punches
  only being used when the enemy gets close. Also in these levels, Batman can use
  a grappling hook to cross dangerous areas unharmed.

  Enemies in the beat'em'up levels usually belong to the Penguin's Red Triangle
  Circus Gang - clowns in all varieties: thin clowns, fat clowns, clowns on bikes,
  clowns armed with bazookas, and more. At the end of each level there is a boss
  fight, including several encounters with Catwoman and the Penguin.
