developer: Tectoy
publisher: Tectoy
description:
  One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he
  started to wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle.
  As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly
  tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind
  those earthquakes.
  .
  Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either
  Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's
  universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.
  .
  Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for
  instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The
  task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures
  matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.
  .
  After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with
  the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will
  receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters
  would like to receive that hammer.
  .
  Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie
  access to the last puzzle and character.

game: The New Zealand Story

developer: Tecmagik

description:
  One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be
  kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black
  market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe,
  managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other
  kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations
  that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook.
  .
  If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear
  and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait
  Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own
  choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties
  that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To
  defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More
  often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of
  fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get
  other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters
  will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots,
  bombs, and fireballs.
  .
  In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and
  the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that
  gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes
  underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface
  again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to
  squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.

game: Joe Montana Football

description:
  Joe Montana (Joe Cool) was an American National Football League player playing
  for the San Francisco 49ers as a quarterback. He was voted by the Associated
  Press as the most valuable player two years running (1989-90).
  .
  In Joe Montana Football the player can play a game of American Football with Joe
  Montana giving the player basic tips on the next best move. The player can play
  against a friend or play the computer with 3 difficulty levels (beginner,
  normal, and professional) in a full game (5 min per quarter) using all the real
  rules and scoring. The teams are made up of 28 American city names with no team
  names (or player names) mentioned. Once the coin is flipped and the kick-off the
  game begins.
  .
  The player controls the on-screen player as they try to run up the field. Once
  the player is downed the game turns to a play selection screen where the player
  can choose their next play (tactic) out of the 17 different preset plays
  available, as well as a punt, attempt at a field goal, or a turnover, all done
  in full view of the opponent (the CPU will change their play to match yours).
  More often then not Joe himself will give a tip on the best play that it will
  default to. On the field the player controlling the quarterback can throw it to
  the receiver (changing the player control to the receiver), change the receiver
  to pass to, or try to run with the quarterback. When play changes hands and the
  player becomes a defender the player has 6 defensive plays to choose from as
  well as a turnover. On the field the player controls a single player chosen by
  cycling though the players or selecting the player closest to the selected
  receiver. Two player mode works the same as single player but with a player
  instead of the computer.

description:
  Shadow Dancer is a one-player game in which you control Shinobi. With the help
  of your dog, you must kill your enemies while you venture through locations such
  as airports, railroads, waterfalls, sewers, and more.  Furthermore, you must
  find and disarm several bombs along the way before you leave each. You also have
  the option of using magic against enemies, which may consist of tornadoes or
  fireballs.
  .
  There are five missions you must complete; and each one has different objectives
  such as obstructing the enemies deadly mission, disrupting the enemy's supply
  route, raiding the enemy's industrial units, attacking the enemy's underground
  forces, and liberating and securing the shuttle's base. Each mission consists of
  three stages and there is a boss on each of the mission's final stages.
  .
  What's good about the dog, you say? Well, if you tell it to, the dog will maul
  enemies (provided that the dog barks at them when you face them) and distract
  them long enough so that you can shoot at them. Remember that you have a limited
  time to do this, as the enemy will eventually kick the dog off him. This causes
  the dog to yelp and shrink, making him powerless against them.

game: Sítio Do Picapau Amarelo

developer: Tec Toy

description:
  Tia Nastácia (Aunt Anastacia) is sick, and Dr. Caramujo (Dr. Snails) is called
  to examine her. And he's got some good and bad news. Good news is that she can
  be cured. Bad news is that, to prepare the medicine, he'll need five rare
  ingredients: bat's blood, Saci's hat, Curupira's salsaparrilha bat, Iara's hair
  and a tear from Cuca. To make things even worse, next night will be a full moon,
  and if Tia Nastácia doesn't get cured until then, she'll sleep for 100 years!
  So, Pedrinho (Pete) and Emília (Emily) are sent to bring the ingredients and
  cure Tia Nastácia.
  .
  Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (Yellow Woodpecker Ranch in English) is based on the
  works of Monteiro Lobato, a Brazilian writer. One or two players (in hot-seat
  mode) can choose to play either the boy Pedrinho (or Pete, in the English
  version of the books) or the rag doll Emília (Emily in the English version). The
  items they must gather are based on Brazilian folklore.
  .
  Gameplay consists in basic side-scrolling/platforming. Either characters can
  jump (button 2), run (either pressing the D-pad twice to a direction, or holding
  a button and the D-pad to a direction), shoot (button 1), and duck. The game has
  four levels (one for each ingredient, the last one with two of them), all set in
  the ranch, with indoor levels, underwater levels, caves and such.
  .
  Each character starts with 3 lives. They have a health bar, which can be
  replenished by gathering items such as nests with eggs, or by freeing birds from
  cages. The enemies faced are most animals, such as bats, bugs, spiders, snakes,
  piranhas, jaguars and monkeys.
  .
  All in game text is in Portuguese.

description:
  Guzzler is an arcade game developed by Tehkan. It was ported to the SG-1000 by
  Tsukuda Original and given Othello Multivision branding. To this day the SG-1000
  version stands as the only home port of Guzzler.
  .
  You play as a character who needs to absorb water to put out fires dotted around
  a maze. The fires also spawn fire-based enemies which can be defeated in a
  similar fashion. You can only store up to three shots at one time.
  .
  Compared to other SG-1000 games, Guzzler shows some very poor production values.
  It thrusts you into gameplay without warning (which can result in cheap deaths)
  and it has a broken pause feature, which although appears to work, will unpause
  the game after a few seconds. There are only three maps and far fewer enemies
  than in the arcade version and it is also a much louder game, as the SG-1000
  omits a high pitched squeak every time you make a step.

  Bart vs. The Space Mutants is a platform game where the player goes into the
  role of Bart Simpson (from the TV show The Simpsons) and must stop the Space
  Mutants from invading Springfield.
  .
  On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients
  that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as
  purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens
  existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family
  members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and
  Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human
  bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart
  must use his X-ray Specs.
  .
  The ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are
  numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects.
  He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little
  puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.
  .
  Bart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like
  buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to
  solve some puzzles in the game.

  Gameplay in this "8-bit" version of GP World is similar in concept to the arcade
  GP World but given the wildly differing hardware, different in execution. Most
  notably all graphics in the game are generated in real-time by the SG-1000
  rather than streamed from a LaserDisc, which in turn leads to more predictable
  car physics. The concept of racing in four different types of GP is scrapped,
  replaced instead with a GP that spans the world and three selectable

  Side-scrolling beat 'em ups in which you must rescue a trapped female friend are

  of this type that were converted from the arcade to home computers are
  particularly commonplace - Renegade and the Double Dragon series are famous
  examples.
  .
  Where this one stands out, however, is the setting of your character as a duck
  called Bin, and with motion having a clear waddling appearance. The enemies to
  fight are all from the animal kingdom, but somewhat warped - crocodiles with
  boxing moves and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin has six levels to

  The gameplay is pretty much the same in Wonder Boy in Monster Land, with Mônica
  side scrolling through twelve locations. She can brandish Sansão against her
  enemies by pressing button 1. Through her way, Mônica must defeat monsters who
  will leave gold when defeated. With that money, Mônica will be able to buy new
  equipment (in proper stores), such as boots, shields, dresses and stuffed
  rabbits. By pressing button 2, Mônica can jump; jumping at certain places
  several times will reveal hidden items. The PAUSE button will display the
  statistics screen, with the amount of life and gold Mônica's carrying, as well
  as special items and equipment. Mônica will also usually find, at the end of
  each location, bosses who will drop lots of gold and a key to unlock the exit.
  The levels have a time limit, and Mônica needs to find hourglasses that will
  appear out of nowhere in order to replenish her hourglass, thus avoiding losing
  health. She can heal herself by buying juice or vitamin drinks at bars, or going
  into hospitals.

  the tracks of all the 15 tracks of the 1989 Motorcycle Grand Prix. There is also
  an extra Arcade track for the player to race on.
  .
  There are 3 modes of play that are Arcade, Tournament, and Grand Prix. In Arcade
  the player races on only 1 track that is named Arcade. In Tournament players get

  track) to all 15 available tracks. Grand Prix is where the player races in all
  15 tracks in order of the 1989 season.

  All races regardless of the mode played in the same way. The game is played on a
  split screen even if only one player is playing. A CPU character named Wayne
  controls the bike on the top screen if there is no other player playing. Wayne
  races like a real player would, having both good and bad races and occasionally
  making mistakes. The race is made up of a Qualify to determine gird position and
  then the Race where the player races 15 other races (including Wayne) over a
  predefined number of laps depending on track length. The track can raced in
  ether the wet or the dry (only dry in Arcade mode) and the weather can change
  from the Qualify to the Race. The races take place on flat roads with straights
  and curves simulating the layout of the real track. On the bike there is a fuel
  gage that simply counts down the seconds left of fuel and is automatically
  refilled at the completion of each lap. If the player doesn’t complete the lap
  before time runs out then the player will “Out of Fuel” and end the race in the
  placed down with other non-finishers. At the end of each race (accept in Arcade
  mode) the player will get points depending on there position before going onto
  the next race.
  .
  The player sets up the bike with some basic set ups that are all available from
  the start. In Arcade mode the player has the options of an Automatic or Manual
  gearbox with either High Gearing (better top speed) or Low Gearing (better
  acceleration). In Tournament and Grand Prix modes the options are extended to
  Engine type of Lean, Medium, and Thirsty which progressively adds speed while
  cutting the time available per lap. There is gearing that works the same as
  Arcade mode, and a tyre type of wet and dry depending on the weather.

  placed on the court. When on the court the player always plays towards the right
  of the court. First the player tries to get the ball from a throw by a well
  timed button press. When the player has the ball the player has the option to
  move, pass the ball, and jump. When jumping the player can shoot, with the
  accuracy of the shot depending on the timing, or just simply pass. When
  defending the player can cycle through the field or just simply run into the
  opponent to challenge for the ball. There are a few penalties that the player
  can get including but not limited to Travelling (not passing after jumping),
  Charging (Sometimes called when the player with the ball runs into an opponent),
  and Pushing (Sometimes called when the player without the ball runs into an
  opponent) with all the penalties resulting with the other team getting the ball
  on the side of the court.
  .
  Also there are two more modes called CPU vs CPU, where the player can get the
  CPU to play itself and Versus Play to play against a friend. In both modes the
  player or players pick one of the 8 nations that are USA, CBA, CHN, JPN, URS,
  DDR, CAN, and FRN all with a character representing a player of that nation. All
  the rules are the same as single player mode.

  Play as Rocky Balboa, the "Italian Stallion" in this action packed boxing game.
  This game reflects the Rocky series quite well. Only in this game you go one guy
  to the next. From Apollo the remaining champion, to Lang an aggressive
  contender, to Drago the Soviet boxer who trains constantly. Before you have a
  fight just like in the "Rocky" movies you have to train. Practice your timing
  and punching strength with some sandbag punching before fighting Apollo.  Warm
  up punching a punching ball to become more faster and smarter to get ready for
  Lang. Then you will do some punching mitts training before fighting Drago where
  you watch the mitts and punch at the as they move. All of these trainings have
  qualifications such as punches per second, qualify and your combinations get
  better for the following fight.
  .
  During a fight you only have one meter under your name, that is the power meter.
  Your opponent has one likewise. Watching your power bar can tell you a lot about
  which way the fight is headed, either it's full and you can take more punches
  and punch more powerfully or it's low and you're in  trouble. Watching the
  opponents power bar will tell you when to take him down or when to block.
  .
  Between rounds you get a chance to freshen up and get some last minute coaching.
  During the one minute interval, your power will go up only half of what has been
  drained.
  .
  If you do happen to take a fall the controls are similar to Nintendos "Punch
  out", basically you just press the 1 and 2 buttons as fast as possible.
  Hopefully Rocky stands up and is ready for more.

description:
  Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working
  late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot,
  thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from
  his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up
  to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating
  plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle -
  workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and
  rescue his dad!
  .
  The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the
  player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the
  basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle,
  whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon
  is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at
  them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down
  the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread
  throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special
  skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby
  Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy
  Shoes, give an extra Continue and more.
  .
  Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and
  raises Bruno's score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several
  entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the
  Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point
  reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing
  your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies.
  The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely
  missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.

  the peaceful city of Radactian was in grave danger. Before taking his last
  breath, the man gave Alex a piece of a map and a medallion made of Sun Stone.

  There are eleven locations in which Alex must explore, each of them has its own
  unique dangers. In each location, Alex can collect bags of coins, which can be
  used to buy items at the shop and are used to help Alex get through each
  location (eg: motorcycle, peticopter, power bracelet, etc.) There are also traps

  stone and vanished from Radactian forever. Later on in the game, Alex must play
  with the same henceman, but only this time, when Alex wins, they decide to play
  dirty.

  Alex uses his fists to wipe out some of Janken's enemies such as birds, sea
  horses, bats, monkeys, frogs, and a few others. If his quest to save Radactian

  bracelet to perform the "Shocking Waves of Destruction", an ancient trick in the

  The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the
  smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire
  button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy,
  eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods
  will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade.
  The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons
  pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any
  enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them.
  You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in.
  Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both
  as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in
  order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking
  missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their
  colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across
  the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow
  one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).
  .
  The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R.
  Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered
  trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other
  shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is
  exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the
  screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the
  levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the
  memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.

game: Cyborg Hunter

developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  It is the year 2242. You are Paladin, the galaxy's toughest bounty hunter.
  Cyborgs are about to take complete control of the universe under the direction
  of Vipron, their evil leader. You are sent to the cyborg fortress to get rid of
  all the chief cyborgs in each of the seven areas.
  .
  The game screen is divided into three sections. This includes a first-person
  view of the map, in which you can see objects that are coming your way. There
  are two types of objects: red objects indicate the lower cyborgs, while white
  ones indicate the chief cyborgs. Next to it is a map of the area, your life and
  psycho power count. Below these is the action screen.
  .
  In each of these seven areas, there are several floors which can be reached via
  the elevator. At the beginning of the game, your only weapons are your fists,
  but weapons can be collected throughout each area, which include psycho punch,
  ray gun, light gun, and bombs. Power-ups like extra life and psycho power can
  also be collected. If you use the psycho punch or psycho gun, your psycho power
  gets depleted, and when it is empty, you must stock up on some more. You can
  also get shields that will protect you from laser beams, and jet engines so that
  you can fly over hazards.\n
  In some areas, you defeat a boss which leaves an ID card, which you can use to
  access other areas of the fortress.
  .
  Some chief cyborgs are easy to kill, while some are hard. You will just have to
  work out which weapon works best with them. The game ends when you lose all your
  life.
  .
  You are not alone in this mission. You also have Adina, your contact back at
  headquarters. Follow her instructions carefully and you may survive.
  .
  Cyborg Hunter is based on the Japanese-only Borgman.

developer: Sega

description:
  Every system must have a Breakout clone, and every self-respecting developer
  must have one, especially in the mid-eighties, following the success of Taito's
  Arkanoid. Sega's answer was called Woody Pop.
  .
  With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your
  ball against bricks laid out in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come
  out to disturb you. When you hit "mystery bricks", wind-up toy soldiers or
  robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a toy train will cross
  your path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big
  black hole as in most other games of this kind – instead the whole covers only a
  part of the wall, so that even if you miss the ball, it might bounce back in the
  corners.
  .
  Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three adjacent rooms
  to progress to, making this game less linear than usual.
  .
  Like any post-Arkanoid game, there is a range of powerups released from special
  blocks. Most are known from other games such as the double-ball, the growing bat
  or the "diamond ball", which destroys all blocks in its path without
  ricocheting. Some invented by Sega are the fire ball, which sets blocks on fire,
  allowing them to destroy even neighbouring blocks, and the big ball, which hits
  bricks with more power, thereby destroying brick with one hit that would
  otherwise have required several.

description:
  The Master System and Game Gear versions of George Foreman's KO Boxing are
  fairly identical to the other versions in concept, but there are a few notable
  changes. The game is a reworking of the Master System title James 'Buster'
  Douglas Knockout Boxing, not to be confused with the Genesis title with the same
  name, which is entirely different.
  .
  Just like the other versions players are cast as George Foreman to go through a
  series of boxing matches against different opponents to win the championship
  title belt. Compared to the other titles, these versions have new opponents and
  show the boxers from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to
  avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that
  can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when
  no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury's
  points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to
  be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow
  or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected.
  .
  Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be
  charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the
  back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the
  ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won
  match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three
  characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.

  The Master System version of Ninja Gaiden is not a port of the well-known NES
  game, but an entirely new game (this includes both a different story and
  different levels) developed by SIMS under license from Tecmo.
  .
  The story is also about the original protagonist, the Dragon ninja Ryu Hayabusa,
  who returns to his clan's village only to find it utterly destroyed and the
  inhabitants murdered. A single survivor tells Ryu in his last seconds that the
  Sacred Scroll of Bushido was stolen. With the power of the scroll its owner is
  mighty enough the gain control of the whole world. Thus Ryu swears to recapture
  the scroll and the avenge the annihilation of his clan.
  .
  The game is sidescrolling platformer/ beat'em up title and incorporates most of
  the mechanics from the NES games: Ryu can jump and attack with his Dragon Sword.
  Furthermore, he can collect different kinds of Ninja Magic (which again vary
  form the powers in the NES games), from shuriken to fire wheels, which can only
  be used finitely many times, as the use up energy which again must be collected.
  However, instead of clinging to walls and climbing them, Ryu can push himself
  off the wall in this game, which must be applied for instance by jumping and
  forth between two close walls to get higher and higher.
  .
  The goal of each level is simply to reach the end of the level before the time
  runs out. Each level is divided into several sections, and at the end of each
  level is a boss fight. After beating a boss, a cut scene is shown which

  Based on the movie of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call who
  will "bust" any ghost hauntings. It does this through the use of nuclear
  accelerated "proton packs" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and
  transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly
  become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased.
  The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing
  ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurect an evil goddess,
  Gozer.
  .
  Ghostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view.
  From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for
  "ghost alarms" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area.
  The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic.
  Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en
  route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the
  ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap
  to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed
  trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it.
  Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to
  purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle.
  Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.
  .
  As the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must
  keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures.
  Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still
  manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.

  get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to

  the same.

  from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he

  Golfamania is a golfing simulation game where players play on an 18 hole golf
  course with all the rules and scoring like in the real game.
  .
  Within the game there are 4 different modes to play on that includes Practice,
  Match Play, Stroke Play, and Pro Tournament. In Practice a single player can
  play any of the 18 holes available. Match Play is 2 player mode against human or
  computer. Stroke Play is the player can play up to 4 others that can include 1
  computer player. In this mode the character skill can increase in 3 different
  areas that are power, accuracy, and luck with the 6 different characters
  available. The main mode is the Pro Tournament and it is where the player plays
  against over 30 computer players (all playing different holes) with the
  objective to score lower than the other players (as per the rules of golf).
  Based on performance the player can earn experience points (XP) that they can
  use to upgrade the power, accuracy, and luck of the character for future
  tournaments. Some of the holes have awards like ‘longest drive’ and ‘hole in
  one’ awards that can earn bonus XP.
  .
  Regardless of the mode the game is played in the same sort of way. The player
  selects a character (the selection depends on the mode) and then sets up the
  character by naming and picking their style.  In all modes but Practice the
  player must pick 3 golf clubs that they must remove from their selection of 17
  different clubs (1-5 wood, 1-9 Iron, Pitching Wedge, Sand Wedge, and Putter).
  When playing the player is presented with a top down view where the player lines
  up the shot and the location on the golf ball they want to hit (for spin). Then
  the player selects the club they want to use (all go varying distances). When
  that is all done the player must play the skill part of the game, where they are
  presented with a power bar that has a marker that going is up and down along it.
  The player must stop the marker on the red area in the centre of the power bar
  to get a good hit (with the center been a perfect hit)and if this area is missed
  the ball will only travel about 20 yards (compared to about 100+ yards of a good
  hit). The amount of red that is on the power bar depends on the golf club used.
  To help the player the distance of the shot can be lowered in exchange for a
  lower marker speed and can be used for shots closer to the hole (very helpful
  for putter shots). The game uses battery backed RAM save to continue play later.

  nitro-fuel boosts, and a gun attached to the steering wheel (which you can use
  to damage the target vehicle), your mission is to patrol the streets and find
  these vehicles.

  does a fly by and drops you some grenades you can use to further damage the
  target vehicle. A guy on a motorcycle will catch up to you and throw grenades at
  your car. And, most importantly, as mentioned earlier, you can shoot at the
  target vehicle rather than just bumping into it.

developer: Sega

description:
  Golden Axe Warrior is a spin-off of the Golden Axe games, a series of
  side-scrolling Beat'Em Ups from Sega.
  .
  In ancient times a horde of giants rebelled against the elders and a brutal war
  ensued. Things looked grave until finally a hero, carrying the Golden Axe,
  appeared and drove back the giants. Since then, the kingdom of Firewood has been
  ruled by a family that had mastered the power of the nine crystals to ward off
  all evil from Firewood. Everyone lived in peace until one of Firewood's
  ministers betrayed his king and sold the nine crystals to Death Adder, one of
  the evil giants. Death Adder has hidden the nine crystals in nine dungeons, has
  unleashed hordes of monsters and is threatening to take over the world. Will
  there be another hero who can find the Golden Axe and defeat Death Adder?
  .
  Gameplay in Golden Axe Warrior is very similar to The Legend Of Zelda, meaning
  you will spend most of your time exploring the large overworld fighting against
  lots of enemies and looking for the dungeons in which the crystals are hidden.
  Inside the dungeons you have to fight more enemies, find treasures and keys,
  solve simple puzzles and defeat the dungeon's boss to get one of the crystals.
  In order to survive against the large number of enemies, you will be able to
  find many different weapons and three different spells.

  The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an
  ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a
  series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless
  beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight

game: SpellCaster

developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  Kujakuo is based on the comic by the same name, published in Young Jump in the
  late eighties and drawn by Makoto Ogino. It is a tale of the occult, centred
  around the buddhist monk Kujaku.
  .
  In this game, Kujaku is sent out by his master, Ajari, to find out what has
  happened at the nearby temple of Hieizan. Upon arriving, after having fought his
  way through magical creatures and deadly warriors, he find his comrades slain.
  One of them, Kubira, is still holding on to his life, and before drawing his
  last breath, he utters the word "Izumo". Ajuri then sends Kujaku to the town of
  Izumo, where he encounters a deadly enemy of unknown origin.
  .
  Kujakuo is part adventure game à la Déjà vu (or, since this is a Sega game,
  Hoshi o sagashite), part platform action. To get between the adventure parts,
  you must pass an action level, as well as a boss fight or two, just as in Cosmic
  Spacehead.
  .
  The adventure part has you looking at a scenery, with a text box for
  descriptions and lines, and a set of verbs on the right. Use a cursor to point
  out specific objects for your verbs.
  .
  In the platform levels, Kujaku can jump and shoot magic bolts. While the usual
  bolt is small, he can load up before releasing them, R-Type style. Pressing the
  pause button opens up the spell menu, for accessing more powerful magical
  spells. New spells can be learned throughout the game. Most spells are
  offensive, but some grant additional powers such as levitation. Each time a
  spell is activated, you use up your limited spirit energy. Enemies will, when
  killed, sometimes drop spheres that will raise your spirit energy, though.

  This game was remade into Spellcaster upon its release in the West.

  As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at
  the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors
  took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge
  his father and redemption would be hard.
  .
  Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit
  computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax
  scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic
  cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing
  between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate
  through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and
  activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a
  sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump
  and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just
  one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also
  traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump,
  duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit
  points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level
  (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to
  the difficulty level.

description:
  If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their
  natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing
  miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain
  found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the
  sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.
  .
  These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track
  painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you
  racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well,
  with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of
  you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to
  avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.
  .
  Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one
  player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting
  your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you
  should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after
  every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within
  your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a
  time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.
  .
  The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4
  points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car
  off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which
  involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level,
  although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared
  the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks
  are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system
  as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

  From Sega 8-bit specialists Aspect comes one of many adaptations of Tim Burton's
  1992 superhero sequel Batman Returns. Like other versions, it is a
  side-scrolling platformer. While very similar to the Game Gear version, the
  Master System version has slightly different levels and gameplay mechanics.
  .
  Batman must move through five stages on his way to defeat the Penguin. These
  include the streets and rooftops of Gotham City, Max Shreck's department store,
  the sewers, and the Penguin's lair. For the first four levels, a route can be
  selected from two options, allowing for different paths through the game.
  .
  Enemies standing in Batman's way can be defeated by throwing the Batarang at
  them. At the beginning, the weapon's range is very limited, but it can be
  expanded by collecting powerups. Other tools Batman can use are a grappling hook
  to pull himself up to higher levels or swing across dangerous areas, and his
  cape, which can be used as a parachute, for more control during falls.
  .
  Unlike in the Game Gear version, there is no health bar: a single hit will kill
  Batman. To compensate, the game contains a generous amount of extra lives.

  Ren and Stimpy just found a pair of hooves which belong to the great Shaven Yak,
  who lost them in the last Yak shaving day. Now they must find the Shaven Yak and
  return him his hooves, or there won't be any more Yak shaving days!
  .
  In this platform game the player is prompted to choose playing either as Ren or
  Stimpy at the start of new life or some stages. Both can jump and shoot (Ren
  shoots toothbrushes, Stimpy spits), but each one has his own special ability:
  Ren can perform high jumps, Stimpy can smash things jumping over them. Each
  character starts the game with three lives.
  .
  Throughout levels such as "The Blacker Than Black Forest", "The Stinking Dry
  Desert" or "The Stinking Wet Bayou", Ren and Stimpy will face most animal
  enemies, such as birds, frogs, vultures, woodpeckers, snakes, etc. The levels
  are divided in few or several sub-level, and at the end of each level, they'll
  face a boss.
  .
  They'll also find some unusual weapons, as a slice of bread (which flies in
  circles), a remote controller (which casts electric waves) and a soap bar (which
  casts bubbles). If they get hit when using a weapon, they'll lose it, but won't
  lose health. They'll gain health by picking items like TVs, cash bags, bottles

  As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter
  based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through
  future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human
  resistance.
  .
  Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate
  (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers
  in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage.
  Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the
  machine guns, and are shot to be collected.
  .
  T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general
  concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns
  down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a
  besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy
  supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time
  to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet
  research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend
  off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.
  .
  Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold
  Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final
  battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns
  (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).

description:
  Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed)
  international teams, each with it's own values for running, ball control and
  strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament,
  playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one
  of them must be completed in one sitting.
  .
  The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key
  aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight
  (lighter balls travel higher, faster  and farther but are more prone to be
  deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are
  slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and
  momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also
  included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a
  lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes
  from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.
  .
  Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D
  effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted
  down to show more of the field.

game: Columns
file: Columns.7z
developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks
  in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3
  same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3
  or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5
  count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The
  real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so
  as to create other lines.
  .
  As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim
  is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of
  bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of
  complete rows which are already in place.

  Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep
  in trouble when they face "Mad Dog" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to
  return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back
  to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:
  .
  1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's
  lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting
  alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.
  .
  2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot,
  spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.
  .
  3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream
  pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the
  targets shoot back.
  .
  4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some
  ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the
  engine to a magic 88 mph.

  One of many games based on the 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park, the version for
  Sega's 8-bit systems combines side-scrolling shooting action and platforming
  levels.
  .
  In each of the five stages of the game, one escaped dinosaur species must be
  recaptured. Each level begins with a side-scrolling driving section. Dinosaurs
  attack the car and must be fend off by firing at them with a crosshair. If the
  player survives long enough, a boss battle against an especially powerful
  dinosaur follows.
  .
  After the completion of the driving section the level continues with a platform
  section. The player must jump, duck and climb to survive moving lifts, floors
  that will crumble under his feet, environmental hazards like acid drops, steam
  leaks or giant boulders and more. Dinosaurs will of course also stand in the
  way, but can be defeated by using several weapons: a rifle, a grenade launcher
  and hand grenades. Navigating the often maze-like levels will lead to the
  dinosaur that must be captured and a corresponding boss fight.
  .
  The first four levels (featuring a Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Triceratops and
  Brachiosaurus) can be tackled in any order, but the final level, featuring the
  Tyrannosaurus Rex, is only unlocked when the others have been completed.

description:
  Streets of Rage, Sega's answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young
  police officers (Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a city
  controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a "Mr. X" where crime is rampant,
  which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the
  syndicate by themselves.
  .
  Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump,
  other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car.
  Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or
  performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if
  holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing
  with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is
  slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but
  a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.\n
  Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right
  (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast
  as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels
  feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing
  enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level.  Several
  items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and
  lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).

  In this platform game, Geraldinho must defeat enemies using his ray gun. The
  enemies will come out of dice-faced boxes, and there will be as much enemies as
  shown at the box face. Once they are shot, they are turned into little balls,
  which must be quickly collected. If they're are not collected in a short period
  of time, they will turn into little creatures which will steal away time. Once
  all enemies are defeated, Geraldinho will proceed to the next level.
  .
  If Geraldinho stands for too long on a platform, it will disintegrate, causing
  him to fall to the platform below. Sometimes this is the only way to get out of
  some closed places.
  .
  From time to time Geraldinho will also play a bonus game, in which he must shoot
  boxes to get objects inside them. He must also avoid boxes with those little
  stealing time creatures.

  each level is to reach a teleporter which will take you to the next one. There
  are also a lot of random items scattered around - weapons, armor, money, and
  food. Money allows you to continue the game if you die, food prevents you from
  starving. The enemies are visible on screen, and you fight them in a fast-paced
  turn-based combat, moving around and pressing direction arrows to strike with
  the equipped weapon. You are always accompanied by an egg which will eventually
  grow up to be a dragon if you have leveled up enough.

  the game starts with graveyard and marsh territory familiar from the first game,
  later levels are set in a tower, a mass of skeletons, and a castle.
  .
  Players progress from left to right (from bottom to top in level 3), and have to
  hack down the aforementioned monsters with a sword. The journey includes ledges,
  ladders, lava pits and slippery slopes. Different weapons can be collected, by
  finding suits of armor inside chests. Each of the five stages has its own
  setting and a final boss.

  As in the movie (and the more famous graphic adventure), your task is to find
  the Holy Grail. Before this can be done you must find the Cross of Coronado, a
  shield and a diary.

  several routes through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed
  with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in

  Most everyone familiar with electronic games has heard of Street Fighter II -
  the most famous beat-em-up series ever. Basically you get a bunch of fighters
  together (12 in this case) and get them to punch, kick, bite and thump the
  bejesus out of each other then you're close.
  .
  Here yet another slightly different version of the game turns up - this time on
  the Genesis. Special Champion Edition is similar in most respects to the
  original Street Fighter II (which never turned up on the Genesis anyway) except
  that all 12 characters are selectable from the get-go (the boss characters were
  originally locked) and the game engine has been revamped.

  Space Harrier 3-D is more like Space Harrier  1 1/2.  While it's not a direct
  sequel to Space Harrier, it was designed to take advantage of the 3-D glasses
  available at the time.  This game is considerably darker than the original and
  the sequel in both look and feel.  Even the digitized voices are deeper in tone,
  creating a sense of urgency about it.  Things are obviously not right in Space
  Harrier's world.  But if you're familiar with the original, the premise is the
  same; blow everything up and fight the boss at the end.

description:
  In order to prevent her boyfriend Minto from going to another little girl named
  Cocco, Papri must collect ten different flowers and return them to her
  boyfriend's house. Flowers must be caught in full bloom so that the number of
  flowers in her possession will increase; catching flowers too early will
  consider the flowers to be wasted and flowers caught too late will be wilted.
  Wilted flowers will ruin the bouquet, causing the player to lose half of the
  flowers.
  .
  Bears have a taste for honey and cause the player to lose one of two hearts if
  one of them attacks the player. However, the honey can be dropped in order to
  render the bear temporarily harmless to the player. Bees appear as the player's
  ally, giving her bonus items occasionally and extra honey if the player catches
  it on a flower.

game: Alien Storm
file: Alien Storm.7z
developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the "Alien Busters" to wipe them
  out and destroy their creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and
  Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.
  .
  When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as.
  There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several
  stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from
  the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens.
  Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get
  tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants,
  postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective
  such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.
  .
  When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot
  to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours
  get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you
  can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see.
  These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of
  the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs
  across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present
  location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will
  then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of
  energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.
  .
  At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to
  complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings
  where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens
  popping up from several locations with the building.
  .
  You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.

  Pitfall II: The Lost Caverns is the sequel to Pitfall and was released for a
  variety of systems during the mid-1980s including the SG-1000 in 1985. Gameplay
  is similar to the original game, but the levels are more maze-like.
  .
  Sega's version of Pitfall II was tweaked significantly from its western
  counterparts released for the Atari 2600, ColecoVision etc. The gameplay is
  largely the same, but there are many additions. These include a Lives system,
  mine-carts, balloons, and a final Demon boss. The SG-1000 version is directly
  inspired by the arcade game, and though cannot match the same level of graphical

  F1 is an Official Formula One Racing Game. There are two modes of play
  available: "Arcade", "Grand Prix". In both of these modes you complete a certain
  number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on.
  The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal,
  Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult.
  .
  There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, "Arcade"
  allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas "Grand
  Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also
  need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection
  screen, but you can skip a track if you want.

  F1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have another player handy, you can

publisher: Sega
description:
  Bandits are holding up a bank and have taken people hostage, and as a
  gunslinger, it's your job to shoot them. The bank has 12 doors, and the bandits
  are behind each one of them. When they pull a gun out at you when you open a
  door, you have only a few seconds to shoot them before they shoot you. If you
  shoot them too early (ie: before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered
  unfair, and you won't score any points, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you
  and you lose one of your three lives.If you waste too much time, a bandit will
  come out from one of the doors and stick dynamite on it. You must then shoot the
  dynamite to get rid of it.
  .
  If you're lucky, either a man or a woman will throw you a bag of gold coins. If
  you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. More often than
  not, the person will throw his/her hands up, saying "I haven't got anything".
  That's when they will be replaced by bandits.
  .
  Some men will carry three to five pieces of gold on top of their heads, and
  shooting at all of the gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. Others will
  be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there's more money for you, because
  not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll get three bags of
  gold coins.
  .
  There are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person
  behind all 12 doors was able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get
  difficult the further you get. For example, in later rounds, a few bandits will
  block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless of what
  round you're on, you can shoot so many bandits before time runs out.

  Alex must then venture in outer space to defeat the evil Ziggurat. Locations

  you control Opa-Opa, a pretty colored ship with wings on its side. You must
  destroy the large creatures in each world before moving on to the next. Your
  task becomes difficult by other small creatures that happen to pass by. If you
  destroy a large creature, they will drop a dollar bill, which you can pick up
  and use at the shop to buy items and powerful weapons such as laser beams, x-way
  shots, and big wings. Another way to get money is to shoot certain kinds of
  enemies all in a row.
  .
  More often than not, some large creatures will reveal a warp gate rather than a
  dollar bill. You can go through the warp gate to get to another part of the
  land, and destroy more large creatures. Only one of them will have a warp gate
  in the form of a 'stop' sign - that is your ticket to the round boss, but you
  must defeat all large creatures in order to pass through it. Also like in the
  original can you walk on the ground to avoid approaching enemies, and spend
  money in the shop to get new weapons (but they only last for a limited time).

  championships, so he was the perfect man to license a home sequel to the classic
  arcade racing game. As before, the action is viewed from within the cockpit, but
  depicted using sprites rather than polygons.
  .
  There are three main modes:
  .
  1. Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race
  followed by three laps.
  .
  2. World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the
  championship mode that affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular
  season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining modes, and cars have
  roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist.
  There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive
  SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player
  must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner
  of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer
  in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too
  many objects or other cars frequently.
  .
  3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for
  championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just
  the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having
  to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps
  (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or
  wet, only on some circuits).

  While each mode presents it's own variations, the core of each race is the same:
  Along controller setup options, the player can choose between an Automatic or
  Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and races against 16 drivers. The car can be
  instantly wrecked if it goes on top speed against a roadside object.

  Your job is to basically find the end-of-level boss, and then defeat it to
  obtain the key that will open the level exit, but your task is made difficult by
  the planet's inhabitants. Get the jet-pack to make it easier to navigate the
  level and shoot any inhabitants that get in the way. These inhabitants will
  leave behind something that you can get to increase your score, and the
  inhabitants will eventually regenerate. If any one of them touches you while you
  have the jet-pack, you land on the ground or the nearest platform, and have to
  get it again; and the same rule applies to the key.

description:
  Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team
  Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their
  fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and
  challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of
  which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who
  progresses.
  .
  You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They
  consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and
  frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and
  tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or
  freeze the opponents.
  .
  The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the
  ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can
  sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars
  which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier
  activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the
  same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the
  stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the
  pitch, in the direction it was going.
  .
  You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear
  on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either
  on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better
  ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved
  to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use
  of them is important.
  .
  A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your
  team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.

game: Trivial Pursuit

description:
  This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd's
  classic board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on
  one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special
  squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on
  the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many
  entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to
  popular British sports.
  .
  Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions
  against the clock) and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five
  human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes'
  or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.
  .
  The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two
  different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology -
  some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of
  music.
  .
  One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis
  of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into
  the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player
  within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when
  choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.

  A small team of Raiden's "Chosen Warriors" survives the attack: Mortal Kombat
  champion Liu Kang and his ally Kung Lao, Special Forces agents Sonya Blade and
  Jax, the shaman Nightwolf, the riot cop Stryker, the nomadic Kabal, and former
  Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero, who has gone rogue from his clan. Facing the warriors
  are the mercenary Kano, cyber-ninjas Smoke, Sektor and Cyrax, Sheeva, a female
  Shokan, the sorcerer Shang Tsung, and Queen Sindel herself.
  .
  Mortal Kombat 3 brings new elements to the 2D fighting series: multi-level
  playfields, "Dial-A-Combo" attacks, a "Run" button to speed up the battles, and
  "Vs." codes, which unlock new powers and abilities once both players enter a
  code sequence in pre-match-up screens. Also included are more stage fatalities
  and finishing moves as each warrior attempts to go one-on-one with the
  Centaurian enforcer Motaro, and Shao Kahn himself.
  .
  Mortal Kombat 3 is the last traditional one-on-one fighting game game in the

game: Fantasy Zone : The Maze
file: Fantasy Zone 3 - The Maze.7z
developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  Sega decided to make their last game in the Fantasy Zone series different. You
  see, the gameplay now involves you going around mazes, collecting all the dots
  while avoiding enemies. You are awarded points for each dot collected, but they
  vary depending on their size. For example, small dots award ten points each,
  while you get 200 points for each larger dot you collect. Once you have
  collected all the dots in the maze, the enemies will turn into coins, which you
  must quickly get in a strict time limit and you move on to the next maze. Just
  before this, though, you get a statistics screen that shows the amount of time
  that you spent in the maze. Points are also awarded, but sadly, if you spent
  over sixty seconds in a maze, you won't get any.
  .
  Every world you travel to consist of three mazes, and after you complete all
  three, a bonus round appears where the object is to collect all coins before
  time expires. While you are collecting the dots in the normal mazes, you must
  touch the enemy's energy, a flashing red spot within each maze to avoid
  2nd-generation enemies from entering the mazes. Some power-ups can be collected,
  which consist of weapons and speed boosters (big wings), which can be collected
  by landing on the circle which it is in. However, you need money in form of the
  amount outlined just before each maze. If you land on a circle while you are
  short of cash, a 'NO SELLING' sign will appear above it, and you have to collect
  some more dots and try again.
  .
  Also you can die by touching an enemy. When you die, a coin will take you place,
  and when you get resurrected, you can grab the coin. The game can be played with
  two players, but the same rule applies in a 2-player game.

  To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy
  blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you
  will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way
  around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will
  cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by
  destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses
  and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks.
  Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal
  with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit
  in which it must be completed.

  certain characters will appear when thirty minutes of each hour is up.
  .
  During the game, you can access a status screen, which helps you keep track of
  the time, what floor you're on, and how many map pieces you collected so far.
  There are six floors inside the castle, including the attic. On some floors,
  there are phones which you can use to either to ask a character for help, or
  order a pizza. There are also alternate solutions to some puzzles in the game.

  decide to buy a present for her. You visit a shady foreign man's shop and buy an
  egg that he promises will hatch a cute pet. When Laila sees the egg, she
  recognizes it as a Mio egg, Mios being a rare animal that is thought to be
  extinct. Since you gave her the egg, it is your responsibility to find out how
  you keep a Mio. Still, the fact that you have a Mio egg should not be known to
  everyone, since scientists will be very keen to take the animal from you for
  purposes of their studies.
  .
  Your quest for the well-being, and eventual mystery, of the Mio animal takes you
  on a quest across several planets, not too far from the planet system of
  Phantasy Star. The game is controlled using an interface popular in Japanese
  adventures of the eighties, mostly identical with ICOM's interface used in
  adventures from the same era, such as Shadowgate or Déjà vu. You can talk to
  people in the game by deciding whom to talk to and the topic, but these
  interrogations have little in common with the more interactive LucasArts
  adventures. Finding out things is often a matter of repeatedly asking, asking at
  the right moment or in the right order. Battery-backed up RAM is not used for

  .
  This top-down perspective soccer game is just like a regular soccer match.
  Offsides, corner kicks and many other rulings make the game authentic. Whether
  on offense or defense, the player must gain control of the ball and score as
  often as possible. The team that ends up with the most goals at the end of
  regulation time wins.

developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  Sega's 8-bit systems received a unique adaptation of Disney's 1992 animated film
  Aladdin.
  .
  Like other versions, it is a side-scrolling action game. The player controls
  Aladdin, making his way through a variety of locations, including the streets of
  Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders, the Sultan's palace and more. Gameplay takes
  several different forms: some levels are chases, where Aladdin runs
  automatically, but must be made to jump over chasms or rolling rocks and
  barrels, evade falling objects and avoid getting caught by a guard. Other levels
  are platforming affairs: Aladdin must run, jump and climb, find keys or switches
  to open doors while searching for the exit. Rocks can be collected and be thrown
  to dispatch enemies or hit buttons otherwise out of reach. Finally, there are
  also several magic carpet rides in the game, in which the level scrolls
  automatically and the player must make sure to avoid any obstacles in the way.

  Made in the hey-day of SEGA's sprite scaling hardware (After Burner, Out Run) in
  the arcades, Galaxy Force is a combination of After Burner and G-Loc R-360 set
  in space.
  .
  The game is divided into four "scenes", or planets: the A world is a green
  planet, world B is a fire-ridden lava planet, world C is a green water planet
  and world D is barren ice planet. You must fly your spaceship above the planet's
  surface, facing not only Space Harrier-style enemy attack waves, but also
  natural phenomena such as meteorites, lava eruptions and tornadoes. To fight
  them, you have a vulcan as well as an undepletable stock of missiles.
  .
  Once you have fought your way across the planet, you enter a tunnel system in
  the inner confines of the planet. As the tunnel turns, you are given directions
  as to which way you must manoeuvre, but the narrow tunnel gives you little space
  to take evasive action. Once you escape the tunnel, the entire planet is
  destroyed, leading you towards the ultimate boss encounter.

game: Road Rash
file: Road Rash.7z
developer: US Gold
publisher: US Gold
description:
  Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the
  role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A.
  Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a
  linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very
  well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs,
  crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion
  and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with
  normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil
  slicks and stray cows.
  .
  By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with
  which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit
  something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus
  your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it
  is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.
  .
  Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no
  intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode,
  this is not simultaneous.

  Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging
  mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky,
  Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch
  from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.

  Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four
  Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and
  Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600,
  progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as
  the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after
  Ms. Pac-Man again.
  .
  Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous

  Carmen Sandiego is an game that tests the player's knowledge about geography and
  general knowledge about different countries. Missions will begin with a treasure
  being stolen and the player flying to that location. A time limit counts down

  figure out what country the thief flew to next. The player always has a limited
  selection (usually three or four) of flights available in any given country.
  This process is repeated until either the villain is found or time expires and
  they are able to get away. Along with finding out where the thief has headed,
  the player must discover who the thief is, by best matching personal
  characteristics (gender, hair color, eye color, hobbies, notable features) to
  dossiers on Carmen's gang. There must be enough characteristics matched in order
  to obtain a warrant, which is essential to legally arrest the suspect once they
  have been found. Progress in arresting VILE members will expose other members,
  eventually leading up to Carmen Sandiego herself.

  Sonic must traverse six zones consisting of three levels each. Most of the zones
  are based on the original game, but some are new. Enemies and power-ups are
  mostly the same as well. Sonic can pick up golden rings for protection (when
  hit, he simply loses all of his rings instead of a life) and bonuses: 100 rings
  gain Sonic an extra life, and 50 remaining rings at the end of a level allow
  access to pinball-themed special stages full of bumpers and springs. The final
  level of a zone is always a boss fight against Robotnik. Sonic should also
  collect the six Chaos Emeralds to keep them from falling into Robotnik's hands.

  stages but somewhere in the regular levels.

  Long ago, in the distant land of Moralos, in a time when vast jungles still

  Aganan, a great warrior, was summoned to save the troubled land and put an end
  to Gilbas by sealing him in the tome from where it came.

  Unfortunately, Gilba was successfully resurrected and another warrior, Danan,
  was called. His quest is to locate the three sacred objects that Aganan used to
  defeat Gilbas: "The Orb of Light", "The Amulet of Light", and "The Knife of
  Light".
  .
  There are about four rounds to complete, and has Danan going through exotic
  locations defeating enemies such as valkyries, ogres, bees, spiders, and several
  others. At the end of each round, you come face to face with a boss, which takes
  quite a number of hits to kill with your sword. Once they are defeated, they are
  likely to give you one of the objects that you need to defeat Gilbas. More to
  the story is then revealed.
  .
  Assisting you with your journey are three animals: an eagle, a monkey, and some
  other animal that I am unfamiliar with. To get these animals to help you,
  however, you will need to collect three of their tokens that are found in yellow
  chests. These animals are quite useful in dangerous situations. The eagle, for
  example, can get a hold of you and fly you to safety if more than one type of
  enemy surrounds you. Anyway, you can get these animals to help you at any place,
  at any time, as long as you have three of its tokens. Yellow chests can also
  reveal extra strength, extra time, or extra health.

game: Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse
file: Mickey Mouse - Castle of Illusion.7z
developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  Sega's 8-bit systems received their own version of the Genesis' popular Disney
  platformer. Story and themes remain the same, but the game has unique levels and
  slightly different gameplay mechanics.
  .
  To save his girlfriend Minnie from the evil witch Mizrabel, Mickey Mouse must
  venture into the Castle of Illusion. Crossing six levels (including a magical
  forest, a toy land and a candy world), he must collect the gems of the rainbow
  in order to confront and defeat the witch.
  .
  Each level features unique obstacles, enemies and a final boss. The enemies can
  be defeated by jumping on top of them. An alternative way is to pick up objects
  lying around (like rocks in the forest or blue balls in the toy level) and
  throwing them at the enemies. Mickey's ability to pick up things and carry them
  around also leads to puzzle-oriented gameplay. By placing objects in the right
  spot and jumping off of them, he can get to areas otherwise out of reach. In
  some levels, he also has to collect keys to open doors. A unique type of object
  is the treasure chest - by jumping on top of one or throwing it, Mickey gets
  access to its contents, which might include extra lives, a health power-up or
  coins to collect for points.

  Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the
  picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on
  screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside
  various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items
  successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they
  will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that
  each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they
  are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets
  that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be
  given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.
  .
  As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the
  ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that
  you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures.
  There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the
  gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights
  shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get
  all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of
  these bonus stages, but each of them varies.

game: Ultima IV
file: Ultima 4 - Quest of the Avatar.7z
developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  The fourth game in the now well-established Ultima series featured an improved
  game engine, with color graphics and better character interaction (you could now
  have actual conversations with NPCs). But what really makes Ultima IV shine is
  its radical departure from any other RPG made before or since in terms of the
  story and goal.
  .
  Instead of building up your character by any means possible in order to face the
  Ultimate Evil in a big bang up showdown, in Ultima IV you were trying to become
  the Avatar, a role model of sorts for the people of the land. This meant
  upholding the "eight virtues" and basically trying to become a better person. In
  most RPGs you chose to be a just/nice hero because the people you'd help would
  usually provide you with some nice equipment for your services, but in Ultima IV
  you helped people not for a reward or to advance the plot but simply because it
  was the "right thing to do". The game actually frowns on behavior that was
  typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing monsters or picking up
  everything that wasn't nailed down even if it didn't belong to you. The game
  keeps track of all your actions, so if you went about killing and looting like
  in most RPGs, you'd never finish the game.
  .
  This VERY different approach to the game's ultimate goal is what makes Ultima IV
  famous so many years later, and became the sort of design philosophy that made
  all the following Ultimas so unique in their genre.
  .
  Of course, the game still has plenty of traditional RPG elements such as
  dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill, as well as a typical final
  "Holy Grail" type quest where you had to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom to
  complete your transformation into Avatarhood.
