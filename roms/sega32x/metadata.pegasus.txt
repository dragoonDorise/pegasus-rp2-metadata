game: After Burner Complete
file: After Burner.32x
developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is
  simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft
  has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns).
  In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all
  the time.
  .
  The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of
  enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you
  spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a
  friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.
