developer: Electronic Arts

description:
  Licensed by the International Management Group (IMG), this rare Electronic Arts
  venture into Tennis features 32 professional players (all male and licensed by
  the IMG) including Bjorn Borg, Marcelo Rios, Patrick Rafter and Yevgeni
  Kafelnikov in 15 tournaments with different surfaces. Game modes include
  exhibition, tour and tournament for both singles and doubles.
  .
  Along the usual offering of lobs, volleys, passing shots, top spins and slashes,
  the player can leave player movement to the console, and just focus on hitting
  the ball with the right shot with the correct timing (the player can also set
  the playing style, from all-court, baseline, or rush net). For those needing a
  boost of confidence before entering competitive play, Vic Braden, one of the
  most well known tennis coaches, has a court with special lines, a ball machine
  and some hints to help them improve their play.

game: Nigel Mansell Indycar

developer: Gremlin Interactive
publisher: Gremlin Interactive
description:
  Newman Haas Indy Car is, as the name shows, a racing game endorsed by the CART
  racing team of the same name and their top driver at the time, Englishman Nigel
  Mansell.
  .
  The player has the option to drive a single race (where the option to practice
  is hidden) or go for the crown against 12 other drivers in 15 tracks (with some
  variety, not only ovals) across North America, with the season opener in
  Queensland, Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen
  or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are
  played in the race.\n
  A key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in
  the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must
  be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a
  disqualification.
  .
  Graphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform
  (and in 16-bit consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of several
  polygonal buildings scattered around the circuits.

developer: Broderbund Software
publisher: Broderbund Software
description:
  The Grand Vizier Jaffar has thrown you into a dark dungeon and plans to marry
  the girl of your dreams in an hour. You're not going to let that happen are you?
  Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through
  the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!
  .
  Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must
  avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with
  the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at
  the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an
  hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation
  of your character.
  .
  The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and
  new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics
  but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.

game: Master Of Monsters
file: Master of Monsters .zip
developer: System Soft
publisher: System Soft
description:
  Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five
  different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that
  stands without a ruler  after the master wizard's death. You can play in two
  campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on
  all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the
  next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human
  players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which
  monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you
  have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus
  conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to
  do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your
  monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters
  can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are
  physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain
  types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a
  preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two
  30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not
  only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you
  control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.

game: Marvel Land
file: Marvel Land .zip
developer: Namco
publisher: Namco
description:
  In the land of Coni, its inhabitants lived in harmony. At its center lies a
  mountain called "Peace", in which an amusement park known as "Marvel Land"
  resides. This park is well-protected by the Fairies. Later, King Mole became
  rule of the under dwellers and sent his minions to take over Marvel Land,
  imprisoning the Fairies inside crystal balls.
  .
  A young lad named Talmit is called upon to rescue Wondra the princess, and free
  the Fairies from King Mole. Marvel Land consists of five worlds with seven
  stages each, and the game plays in platform style, in which you need to run
  through the level, killing enemies, and find the exit door. More often than not,
  you have to go through a bullseye to reach it. If you hit the bullseye at its
  center, you are awarded more points than you do by hitting it above or below.
  .
  You kill enemies by either jumping on their heads or attacking them with clones,
  which trail your movement unless you use them to attack enemies or collect food.
  The clones have a limited life and disappear one by one as you use them.
  .
  During the game, you can open any treasure chests that you may find along the
  way, and release power-ups which include boots that make you increase your
  speed, dragon wings that enable you to jump higher and giving you the ability to
  glide to a soft landing, and giving you the use of the "clone" attack. Hidden
  throughout the sections are warp doors that can either take your backwards or
  forwards, anywhere within the park. Each section of a world has you riding a
  roller coaster, in which you must stay on the cars while avoiding signs and
  enemies.
  .
  The last section of each world has Talmit going through the castle to reach the
  end-of-world boss. Unlike other platform games where you must defeat bosses with
  weapons, you are challenged to various mini-games starting from "rock, paper,
  scissors" through to the Musical Chairs variant. If you win one of the
  mini-games, you are able to free one of the Fairies, and obtain a crystal ball
  that you need to defeat King Mole. You then proceed to the Bonus Stage where you
  must collect shooting stars for points. If you lose a mini-game, you are
  transported back to the start of the last section.

  Kid Chameleon is a side-scrolling platform game in which the main character has
  entered a virtual reality game called "Wild Side" to free the other kids inside
  that have been captured (*cuckoo*). He can change his shape into various other
  forms (hence the "Chameleon"). This gives him special abilities which must be
  used to pass each of the game's 100+ stages.
  .
  An interesting point about Kid Chameleon is that the game has 100+ levels (most
  of which are very, very difficult) which must be played in sequence AND there is
  no save feature or password feature - which means completing this game would be
  a major feat of endurance (and patience).

description:
  The Algo star system is in troubled times...
  .
  Many thousands of years ago, the Algo Star System was a peaceful system. Three
  planets surrounded the peaceful Algo star and were in perfect harmony: Palma, a
  lush green planet, where its citizens devoted their lives to arts and the
  sciences. Motavia, a desert planet, inhabited by humans and native Motavians,
  and the enigmatic Dezolis, a harsh ice planet, where the citizens were just as
  unknown as the planet itself. Unfortunately, the harmony and balance was not to
  last. Palma had exploded, and with it, 90% of the population of Algo died.
  Motavia had fallen into horrible conditions from the explosion, turning almost
  into a total wasteland. The Darkness spread its hand over the land...
  .
  Now, 1,000 years had passed. Motavia had healed somewhat, and life was beginning
  to return to the way it once was thousands of years ago. The Hunter's Guild on
  Motavia helped to keep things steady. But now, a dark evil once thought to be
  long dead is beginning to stir once again, and the young Hunter, Chaz, is about
  to begin his ultimate adventure - and all of it started with one simple routine
  assignment...
  .
  The gameplay of the fourth entry in the  Phantasy Star is similar to that of the
  second installment, sharing notable features such as the ability to equip two
  weapons at once, different healing items for humans and androids, most of the
  "techniques" (equivalent to magic spells in comparable games), etc. As before,
  leveling up and technique-learning is automatic. There are a few segments in the
  game with vehicle combat, which mostly follows the same turn-based formula as
  the regular battles. Side quests are present in form of hunter assignments for
  Chaz and his friends.

  You attack your enemies by shooting them with small metal orbs that come out of
  TinHead's head. You can shoot them in three different directions: diagonal
  upward, straight, or just let them jump out and bounce over the ground. The

description:
  Following the previous two Road Rash games, the player has conquered the US
  illegal motorcycle championship. But why settle for that when one can take over
  the World; racing in the peaceful streets of the UK, dodging the animals in
  Kenya, blaze through the night in Japan or jump in the hilly circuits in Italy?
  .
  Keeping the same spirit of the previous two games, Road Rash 3 adds all new
  digitized sprites (based on the 32-bit remake released an year earlier), bike
  upgrades, more weapons and meaner police. Most other aspects of the game remain
  unchanged: the player starts on the lowest division with a small amount of cash
  and a slow, hard to handle bike. To get more money (and get a faster bike) the
  player must beat as many of the other 15 racers to the finish line, using all
  means possible, even kicking and punching them into knockout. By clearing
  (finishing on the top three spots) all five races on a level, the player
  advances to the next, where opponents are faster and tougher, the police is more
  active and a longer race.
  .
  As for new gameplay elements in the final title in the series released for
  Sega's 16-bit console, bikes can also be improved by choosing cheaper upgrades
  (instead of simply buying new ones) such as tires (less skidding), engine
  (improves acceleration and top speed), suspension (allows better control while
  landing after jumps) and body (bike takes more hits before turning into smoking
  metal). Instead on relying on simple motorbike patrols, the police now has
  helicopters at their disposal (which try to land on the player) and patrol cars,
  which attempt to block the path of the bike, forcing it to stop or collide to
  get a bust. To make things easier (or harder), new weapons were added, some of
  which allow the carrier to stun an opponent for a few seconds, making him the
  perfect victim for an incoming vehicle. Also new, if the player finishes the
  race with a weapon, carries it to the next race.
  .
  Each track has it's own features: in the UK, cars drive left on a rainy day, in
  Australia and Kenya animals wander into the road, in Brazil bikers can get
  themselves a close-encounter with a car on a crossing, in Italy the hills allow
  a lot of air-time for light and speedy bikes, Germany, where the icy roads and
  sharp turns make a deadly combination and finally in Japan the race goes during
  the night under the neon lights.

description:
  Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games
  held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the
  console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles,
  pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and
  archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics,
  or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events,
  and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow
  competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.
  .
  Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes
  compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two
  qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction
  can earn world record times.
  .
  Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely
  pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then
  set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests,
  three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex
  pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and
  good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round
  composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where
  they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition
  continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.
  .
  The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping
  events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed
  by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight
  allowed three more attempts.
  .
  Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the
  goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of
  the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to
  the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards
  and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed
  directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal
  is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for
  each.

description:
  The ghost of a teenager seeks revenge against a snobbish family.  Your job is to
  scare them out of their house(s).  They can't see you so your only means of
  scaring them is by possessing various objects throughout the household.  For
  example, possessing a piece of furniture would cause something to fly out from
  it and possessing an object would make it come alive in some way or another.
  You need to act quickly because you have something called "ecto" which acts as
  the fuel that allows you to roam the real world.  You're awarded more ecto each
  time a family member exists the room.  The more scares you did, the more ecto
  you gain.  Losing all ecto sends you to the underworld where you have to regain
  your ecto to full capacity in order to go back into the real world.

  Shove It! The Warehouse Game is a top-down puzzle game based on the original
  gameplay of Soko-Ban Hiroyuki Imabayashi wrote for Thinking Rabbit. The player
  controls Stevedore, a warehouse keeper, from a top-down view. As shown on the
  title screen, shoving boxes will earn him money to make his dreams come true, a
  lovely girlfriend and a fiery red sports car.
  .
  The game consists of 16 stages with 10 rounds each. At a certain stage, any of
  the 10 rounds can be selected while playing but a new stage will only be opened
  up when all rounds have been successfully completed. To complete a round,
  Stevedore needs to push all boxes on the designated spots. This will turn them
  into a different colour. This is no easy task as the level design will obstruct
  many moves and cornered boxes can no longer be moved. While playing it is
  possible to restart the round, undo the last step and the game keeps track of
  the number of steps taken.

  Streets of Rage, Sega's answer to Final Fight, follows the story of three young
  police officers (Adam Hunter, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding) in a city
  controlled by a criminal syndicate led by a "Mr. X" where crime is rampant,
  which leads the three heroes to make a pact to leave the force and topple the
  syndicate by themselves.
  .
  Gameplay is straightforward and simple. Three buttons are used, one to jump,
  other to attack and another to perform a range attack from a support police car.
  Each character has a limited set of moves that include punching and kicking or
  performing a back attack (if in the open), two grapple moves (depending if
  holding the opponent in front or by the back), a flying attack, and if playing
  with another player two additional tag attacks, and different abilities: Adam is
  slow, but a good jumper and a hard hitter, Axel fast and also a hard hitter, but
  a lousy jumper and Blaze fast and a good jumper, but weak hitter.\n
  Levels are in typical arcade side-scroller fashion: move from left to right
  (with two exceptions), clearing screens from enemies one after another as fast
  as possible while avoid taking damage with a boss in the end. Some levels
  feature "death drops" where the player must avoid falling, while throwing
  enemies there at the same time, including a typical elevator level.  Several
  items are scattered on the ground, from melee weapons and bonus points (and
  lives or additional police cars) to apples and turkeys (to restore health).

  that are behind him. Some enemies in the game carry different types of weapons

description:
  Based on the popular Where's Waldo series of books, the player's goal is to find
  Waldo, who is hidden in various pictures, before the time on the clock runs out.
  The player controls a magnifying glass and must click on various items for
  different effects. Finding a clock adds more time to the search, clicking on a
  150 icon adds 150 points to the score, etc.
  .
  Each picture consists of 6 adjacent screens containing a continuous theme. The
  themes are The Carpet Flyers, The Underground Hunters, The Battling Monks, The
  Unfriendly Giants and The Land of Waldos. Players are given the option of
  playing on Normal difficulty, Expert difficulty, or playing the Land of Waldos
  stage. The only difference between the difficulties is that on expert there are
  no clock items to provide players with extra time.
  .
  In all of the stages the player must find both Waldo and a scroll to complete
  the stage. Waldo must be found before the scroll in order to complete the stage.
  Waldo's dog Woof is also in each of these stages (except for the Land of Waldos)
  and by finding him players get to play a small bonus stage where they collect

  1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. As the name suggests, Izzy must find the five
  Olympic rings, hidden by the guardians so that Izzy does not take them to his
  world.
  .
  The game plays a lot like Mario games; to eliminate an opponent Izzy must jump
  over his head. There are two jumps available, the ball jump suitable for height
  and the hurdle jump, suitable for distance. Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy,
  but the second harms  him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at
  the next hit he loses a life. There are some extra objects, like Olympic
  torches, and eggs that hatch either objects for bonus points, trampolines or
  morph points to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or traps. Izzy can also morph
  into a glider, a baseball player, an archer or a rocket, among others, to
  overcome some sections of the levels.

developer: Codemasters
publisher: Codemasters
description:
  If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their
  natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing
  miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain
  found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the
  sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.
  .
  These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track
  painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you
  racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well,
  with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of
  you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to
  avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.
  .
  Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one
  player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting
  your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you
  should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after
  every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within
  your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a
  time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.
  .
  The real innovation of the game was in the multiplayer modes. You started with 4
  points each, and when one car gets far enough ahead to force the other car
  off-screen, the slider moves in their favour. Once it reached the end (which
  involved beating them 4 times more than they beat you) you win the level,
  although if 3 laps were completed, the person leading at that point is declared
  the winner - with a sudden death play off if scores are level. 9 of the tracks
  are available in this mode, although you can also play this Head to Head system
  as a 1-player game across all the tracks.

  Evander Holyfield's "Real Deal" Boxing is a boxing simulation.  Holyfield is the

  like Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, the developers went for a more strategic sim. The
  game is played from a pseudo-3D side view with moving around the ring handle by
  scrolling the backdrop and moving the ropes. A top down camera is shown at the
  top of the screen.
  .
  Players can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the
  Career mode, using a created boxer to work their way up the 30-boxer ranking
  list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character creation, players can
  choose the fighter's color of skin, trunks and hair, haircut, dominant hand and
  stats emphasis. Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign
  the boxer to improve his stats.
  .
  During the fights, besides an energy bar, the fighters have a head and a torso
  damage meter. This meters are images of their head and torso, which become
  gradually grey, from top to bottom, as they are hit. If one of these meters
  becomes totally grey, it will start blinking, warning that it the fighter takes
  some more punches on that area, he will loose the fight by TKO. Being knocked
  down tree times in a round also leads to a TKO. During the rounds' breaks,
  fighters regain strength as the girl with the round sign passes along their
  sides.
  .
  Fighters can perform three types of punches: jabs, hooks and uppers, which can
  be aimed at the opponent's head or torso. Fighters can also taunt their
  opponents. If by some reason the fighters avoid to fight, the spectators will
  start to hiss at them. To keep the spectators pleased, the fighters must keep
  punching each other on a regular basis.

  Twin Hawk is a typical vertical scrolling shooter with a top-down view. Your
  goal is easy, shoot all the enemies along the way. You only get a standard gun
  on your plane, and no bombs! Instead of bombs you can call helper planes. These
  planes make a formation around you and help to shoot all enemies.
  .
  Along the way you get the chance to collect power-ups by shooting transport
  trucks. When these are destroyed they release a power-up. There are 3 types.
  First is the weapon upgrade, with this you get a wider and more powerful shot.
  Second, you get more calls for helper planes. And third are extra lives.

description:
  This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin's earlier Lotus series, in terms
  of its general look and feel, right down to the text font used in the game. Your
  task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with
  many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza
  layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver).
  .
  These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you
  race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the
  top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in
  thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires
  (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal
  approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when
  upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password.
  .
  You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus
  nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as
  puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.

  who saw his girlfriend Daisy kidnapped and taken hostage by Zaks, and it's up to
  him to restore the Yolkfolk to normal and rescue Daisy from the top of the Cloud

  The most technically-advanced of Dizzy's adventure games in many ways, it was
  the only one to feature actual scrolling rather than a flick-screen system, the
  only one not to be released for the 8 bit computers the character originated on,
  the only one to originate on a console, as well as featuring many mini-games,

  Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the levels, picking up objects and using
  them to solve simple puzzles. There are plenty of tests of arcade skill along
  the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and baddies avoided - starting with a

  Sparkster is the sequel to Rocket Knight Adventures and is completely different
  from the contemporary SNES title Sparkster. It takes place immediately after the
  events of the first game. The interactive introduction scene shows Sparkster
  picking up a new sword after the final fight when his nemesis Axel Gear appears,
  the rocket knight gone evil. After a fight in giant robots, Sparkster manages to
  save Princess Cherry and returns her to the queen. Then suddenly Axel appears
  again and he kidnaps her. It turns out Axel is working once more for the Empire
  of Gedol. Sparkster has to return the peace in Kingdom of Zebulos, save the
  princess and bring an end to the evil empire.
  .
  The game consists of six levels with 2D side-scrolling platformer gameplay. The
  opossum Sparkster can move around, jump and attack with his sword. Using his
  rocket pack, he can also perform stronger attacks and burst through the air in
  different directions. The rocket power consists of a double meter that refills
  gradually, making it possible to perform successive attacks in the air,
  ricocheting off walls. The first meter allows for the strongest attacks, but
  fills more slowly. Sparkster collects diamonds, apples to restore health and
  different types of power-ups for his sword. Most levels have typical platform
  gameplay, but there is also a level where Sparkster walks around in a giant
  robot, knocking enemies out of the air.
  .
  For an additional challenge players can locate the seven swords hidden
  throughout the levels. When all of them have been found, the hero turns into
  Golden Sparkster. The game includes a password system.

  Westwood Studios' real-time strategy classic Dune II received a major overhaul
  when ported to the Sega Genesis. While the basic concept remains the same, the
  game features all-new graphics, streamlined controls, changes to the tech tree
  as well as completely new levels.
  .
  As in the original game, the player controls the troops of one of three noble
  Houses, called by the Emperor to mine the Spice Melange on the planet Arrakis,
  also known as Dune. A series of consecutive battles must be won by mining spice,
  constructing a base and building units to attack the enemy.
  .
  The rather complex menu-based controls of the original game have been replaced
  by a context-sensitive cursor system, where a unit reacts according to what is
  below the cursor - either moving to a destination or attacking an enemy unit,
  for example.
  .
  The tech tree has been simplified: Among other changes, concrete slabs are only
  available in the 4x4 size, there is only one type of vehicle factory and the
  advanced units do not require an IX research center anymore.
  .
  Finally, the progression of levels in the console version is strictly linear, as
  there is no choice of the next map to be played as in the original version.

developer: Razorsoft
publisher: Razorsoft
description:
  In the future all intergalactic disputes must be settled by a duel to the death.
  Nine galactic superpowers take control of the flight paths, leaving the
  Federation unable to operate. To regain the paths, the Federation sends in
  Barrett Jade inside a giant cyborg. He has to battle to death and defeat the
  other nine superpowers' contestants to regain control.
  .
  Death Duel is a tactical side-scrolling first-person shooter. The game consists
  of different time-limited rounds against a single enemy. Before each game, the
  player can spend Pheelae (money) on repairs and determine what weapons to take
  into battle. Each opponent has specific weaknesses and they can hide behind
  walls on the battlefield. To take them out, Jade needs to choose the most
  effective weapons and target specific parts before he runs out of time and ammo.
  Weapons include missiles, rockets, grenades that slow the opponent down, a
  machine gun and more. Only three weapons can be acquired at all times. Between
  missions there are short gallery shooting mini-games where additional money can
  be acquired.

game: Devilish

developer: Genki

description:
  Genki's first game is a paddle/pong game with a background story. Once upon a
  time there were a prince and a princess who loved each other. But the evil
  jealous demon named "Y" turn them both into stone paddles. Suddenly, a blue
  sphere fell from the sky, becoming the ball which the paddles can now push
  forwards, overcoming obstacles and defeating demons.
  .
  "Devilish" is different from other paddle games by letting you play with two
  paddles. The lower one behaves just like a usual paddle - you use it to prevent
  the ball from dropping down. The upper one can move and turn, allowing you to
  hit the ball from different angles and from different parts of the screen. You
  advance through levels by destroying bricks and enemies, going up until the
  level boss enemy appears.

game: General Chaos
file: General Chaos .zip
developer: Electronic Arts
publisher: Electronic Arts
description:
  General Chaos is an arcade-style squad RTS where the player controls a team of
  five soldiers in a limited battleground, in a classic Red (General Havoc,
  headquarters in Viceria) vs Blue (General Chaos, in Moronica) all out war. The
  goal of the game is to push the frontline to the enemy headquarters, by winning
  individual battles and then beat them in their own capital.
  .
  There are five kinds of soldiers, each with their weapon of choice and range of
  attack: the Gunner (machine gun, medium range and wide arc), Launcher (rocket
  launcher, long range), Chucker (grenades that can be thrown over barricades),
  Scorcher (flame-thrower, close combat) and Blaster (dynamite sticks, close
  range). Before each battle, players can choose the composition of their team
  from one out of four choices: Assault team, Brute Force, Commandos (a team of
  just two soldiers which have different controls) and Demolition.
  .
  Gameplay is simple to learn, with the A button being used to fire at the nearest
  enemy, B to move to a the pointer location and C to cycle through soldiers.
  Using the commando team changes the controls, with the directional pad
  controlling a soldier directly, with B being used to call the other soldier
  nearby. While basic commands are simple, the player must deal with things such
  as distance from target and angle of attack to succeed.\n
  If two opposing soldiers face-off during battle, they engage in a brawl
  (indicated by a cloud of dust). When that happens, the battle stops and the
  players are in direct control of the soldiers: A punches, B kicks and C blocks.
  Every downed soldier can can be rescued if there are enough medics available,
  earned at the end of each battle depending on how well the player did.
  .
  Up to four players can play, cooperatively or against each other.

description:
  Muhammad Ali Heavyweight Boxing, as the name implies, is a boxing game featuring
  the three-time World Heavyweight Champion. The game display 2D sprite-drawn
  boxers in a 3D ring (the so-called "FreeCam" 3D system), with the boxers moving
  around the ring in 360°.
  .
  One or two players can choose the number of rounds (up to 15), the round length
  (up to 5 minutes), the number of times a fighter must be taken down to be T.K.O.
  and the number of referee counts (up to 10). There are two game modes:
  exhibition (which can be played against the computer or one-on-one by two
  players) and the tournament mode (single player). Players can choose among nine
  fictional fighters plus Muhammad Ali himself.
  .
  There are two control types: arcade and simulation. In the arcade mode, the
  d-pad moves the boxer around, while the A button is used for jabs, the B button
  for defense and the C button for hard punches. In this mode, the game decides
  which of the boxer's arms will be used for each punch. In the simulation mode,
  the d-pad moves the player around. By holding the A button (for the left arm) or
  C button (for the right arm), the player can perform head jabs (by pressing up
  in the D pad), body jabs (by pressing down), body hooks (by pressing left) and
  body hooks (by pressing right). Holding the B button, the player can cover up
  (by pressing up), duck (by pressing down), sway left (by pressing left) and sway
  right (by pressing right). By pressing A and B together, the boxer performs an
  uppercut.
  .
  Each fighter has a power and a speed bar. As they get tired by fighting or get
  hurt, the bars decrease. The lower the bars, the slower or weaker the punches
  get, until the boxer is knocked down. By defending himself a boxer can regain
  power or speed. There's also a counter of punches landed at each side of the
  screen. If the fight ends with no winner, the judges decision is made by those
  numbers alone, regardless of how many times the fighters were taken down during
  the fight.
  .
  The game features digitized speech, including samples of Ali's voice.

game: X-perts
file: X-perts .zip
developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  X-Perts was an extension of Sega's Eternal Champions Universe.
  .
  It starred one of EC's fighters (Shadow Yamamoto) in an unique action adventure
  game. She lead a team of elite X-Perts to do impossible missions. The game was a
  mixture of action, adventure and strategy.
  .
  X-Perts was set in an futuristic underwater research lab called AQUA, besieged
  by terrorists. The player controlled 3 characters, each with unique fighting
  moves and specific skill knowledge. All characters and backgrounds were
  pre-rendered in 3D, to give it a very high end graphic look.
  .
  The player had to react to events happening in the lab to progress the game and
  avoid destruction, while battling both the terrorists and the stations defenses.
  .
  This was done by direct and indirect control of the X-Perts through the entire
  lab (roughly 20 different levels.) The player used a special RECOM screen to
  monitor his characters placement across the separate areas of the lab, as well
  as all mission objectives, enemies, facility robots and other hazards.
  .
  Using direct control of a character, you would move around and between levels
  and directly combat enemies. The player could also activate tasks for mission
  objectives. The time it took to complete a task was based on the strength of
  their Engineering and or Computer Science skills.
  .
  Missions were constantly being generated and some were time dependent (missing
  it usually meant the situation got worse for the X-Perts), so hopping between
  X-Perts and assigning the ones with the best skills for the task was important.
  Some secondary missions allowed character upgrades to their personal weapons.
  .
  Characters could also use 3 unique torture moves each to get information from
  the enemies instead of killing them. This would sometimes be needed for mission
  objectives. However, if not executed properly, it would instantly kill the enemy
  instead.
  .
  The game modeled all 20 levels of the lab in real time, so even when you left a
  character to activate another, it would still continue to perform its task until
  it was attacked by enemies, and would automatically defend itself, but to a
  lesser extent then if you directly controlled it.
  .
  The game was broken down into chapters (save points) and each chapter remembered
  the status of the entire lab environment (enemies, flooded areas, broken power
  grids, hacked computers, active forcefields.)

  Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a

  gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your
  direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass...

  The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is
  longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to
  perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so
  on.

  Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your
  crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck,
  or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose
  several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again.

  This game lets you play two-on-two arcade basketball with players from all the
  NBA teams. Gameplay is fast and action-packed, with few rules, no fouls, and
  deliberately unrealistic jamming. Players are rated on eight ability categories,
  from steals and blocks, to dunks and 3-pointers.
  .
  Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player
  for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face
  each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player
  with a CPU team-mate.
  .
  The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for
  substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which
  lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover.
  Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes
  four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu:
  .
  1. "Hot Spots" are randomized zones on the court that reward extra points (up to
  a 9-point shot!) for making a basket while standing within them.
  .
  Powerup icons appear randomly, and convey temporary arcade-like benefits when
  picked up. Some examples are instant "on-fire," enhanced 3-point accuracy,
  monster dunks from anywhere on the court, or a bomb that knocks all other
  players to the ground.
  .
  "Juice Mode" increases the speed of the game up to 4x.
  .
  "Tournament Mode" disables all other modes, special characters, and cheats, and
  challenges you to defeat all the NBA teams to unlock extra players (2 extra
  players for almost every team). Winning Tournament Mode also unlocks a higher
  CPU difficulty level.

developer: Western Technologies
publisher: Western Technologies
description:
  Menacer 6-Game Cartridge was released as a pack-in cartridge for the Menacer
  light gun. It is a compilation of six games:
  .
  1. Pest Control: in this game the player has to defend a pizza from the attack
  of assorted bugs. The player smokes the bugs while controlling a spotlight, but
  it is also possible to see the whole table while pressing a second button (in
  this case, it won't be possible to use the insecticide). The game is over when
  the pizza is all eaten. Different bugs will appear throughout the levels, such
  as some big ones which explode in smaller ones when shot.
  .
  2. Space Station Defender: the player has to shoot aliens inside pods which
  appear on the screen in a given sequence and in specific positions. As the
  player follows the pattern, he has to reload the weapon by aiming the lower end
  of the screen where "power" can be read. There's also a random mode, where all
  pods appear at the same time and the player has to guess the order in which
  they'll open. The aliens shoot back if the player takes much time to shoot them.
  Once in a while a little flying saucer will cross the screen; shooting it will
  give the player a shield point. The game is over when player's life is depleted.
  .
  3. Ready, Aim, Tomatoes!: this game is set in Toejam & Earl's universe. As the
  screen scrolls right, Toejam has to shoot tomatoes at enemies such as the Cupid,
  the Dentist, the Boogie Man, the little Devil and so on. There are also special
  items to shoot, like bombs which will kill all enemies at the screen or tomato
  baskets which will give ammunition. For each level there's a target score to
  achieve. In advanced levels the enemies will shoot back. The game is over when
  Toejam's life is depleted.
  .
  4. Whack Ball: this is some sort of a Breakout game. The player controls a
  paddle and has to bounce a ball against a frame of blocks. Once a block is
  touched by the ball, its color is changed, and the objective is to change all
  blocks colors. Some glowing blocks have special effects when hit like sticking
  the ball to the paddle, giving an extra ball or shrinking the paddle. A time
  limit is given to each leval, and if the player doesn't succeed, another chance
  is given. The game is over when all balls are lost though the holes in the
  frame.
  .
  5. Front Line: in this game the player has to shoot tanks, trucks, planes and
  helicopters before they shoot back. There are two weapons available: a cannon
  with unlimited ammo and 10 missiles per stage.
  .
  6. Rockman's Zone: in this game the player has to shoot cardboard pictures of
  bandits while avoiding shooting pictures of women, children and policemen. Bonus
  points are given for acurracy.
  .
  In the shooting games the player can choose to have the Accu-Sight on or off. If
  it is on, a crosshair will be displayed. If it's off, the player can also choose
  to use the Menacer's Binocular Module.

  various different game adaptations. RoboCop versus The Terminator on the Genesis
  is only loosely based on the comic.

  The player controls RoboCop who during his duty of policing the streets of
  Detroit is lured into a trap by Terminators sent from the future. By uploading
  himself into the computer network, he becomes the seed from which the malevolent

  once and for all.

  Last Battle (known in Japan as Fist of the North Star: Legend of the New Era
  Savior) is a 2D side-scrolling brawler developed and published by Sega for the
  Sega Genesis on July 1, 1989 (in Japan) and August 14, 1989 (in North America as
  a launch title).nnnnSet in the war-torn future, players take on the role of
  wandering Jet-Kwon-Do fighter Aarzak as he fights to reclaim his homeland from
  the empire of the evil Duke, only to journey to the land of the unknown to
  rescue one of his traveling companions, Alyssa, from three seemingly-invincible
  rebel generals (Gromm, Gross, and Garokk).nnnnThe original Japanese version of
  the game is the sequel to the 1986 Sega Master System brawler Fist of the North
  Star (based on the post-apocalyptic martial arts manga and anime of the same
  name) and details the events of the second anime series (itself the last half of
  the manga series). Like its predecessor, the international version of the game
  was localized to remove both the series's trademark extreme violence and all
  direct references to the source material (though its post-apocalyptic setting
  and plot elements remained).

developer: Sega

description:
  The premise is that two opposing forces are in combat with one another. Each
  player controls a jet airplane which zooms across the screen and may turn into a
  ground based soldier. These ground soldiers can hurt enemy units, but can not
  affect bases. To take over bases scattered across the map (and ultimately, the
  enemy base), players must purchase new units and transport them to certain
  positions. In this way, the player acts more like a transport and management for
  different types of units rather than a combat character themselves. If the plane
  is ever destroyed, it restarts at the player's base location. As previously
  mentioned, a level is complete when either side's base is lost to the opposing
  forces.

developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  Streets of Rage 3 aimed to build on the success of its predecessor, so while the
  style of gameplay and control scheme is largely identical to its predecessors,
  significant changes were made to the overall structure of the game. Streets of
  Rage 3 is a faster paced release with longer levels, a more complex plot (which
  in turn leads to more in-depth scenarios complete with interactive levels and
  multiple endings) and the return of traps such as pits. Dash and dodge moves
  were added to each character's arsenal of moves, and weapons can now only be
  used for a few times before breaking.
  .
  Changes to the fighting mechanics allows for the integration of weapons with
  certain movesets. Team attacks, absent from Streets of Rage 2 but available in
  the original Streets of Rage, make a return, and are occasionally used by
  enemies too. Blitz moves, performed while running, have also been altered and
  are now upgradable over the course of the game (predicated on how many points
  are earned per level). Death causes a downgrade, however holding the X button
  before a series of button combinations can give players access to the upgraded
  moveset at any point in the game, at the expense of the time taken to perform
  attacks.
  .
  Enemies are also smarter with weapons, and some can even steal health upgrades,
  and there are also several secret playable characters, unlockable after
  overcoming certain conditions during the game. Special moves also no longer
  drain the user's health - a separate, automatically regenerating bar is
  introduced for this purpose.

description:
  This is a conversion of Sega's popular motorcycle racing arcade game.  In this
  game you race a motorcycle around the world, completing each section of track
  within a time limit. There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not
  important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a
  different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are
  senior, and Europe is expert.
  .
  This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in
  2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are
  steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your
  speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off
  the road slows the bike down.

  In the year 2998, humanity has finally reached the stars, and was able to build

  Nebula began to spread, threatening to engulf the galaxies controlled by humans.
  It turned out that a robotic dictator named Super Mech was behind this
  occurrence. The Earth sends Captain Lancer, a skillful pilot navigating the
  powerful CNCS1 aircraft, equipped with the most powerful weapon: the Hellfire...
  .
  This is a horizontal space shooter, with the traditional premise of a lone pilot
  traversing hostile areas and out-manoeuvring and/or destroying quick and
  numerous enemies. What sets this shooter apart from many other horizontal space
  shooters is that you choose the direction of your shots at any time between
  forward, backward, upward+downward and 4-way diagonal. The 4-way diagonal shot
  is usually the most effective and makes for some interesting gameplay setups,
  such as stationary guns you can only reach by passing them (while avoiding their
  shots) and then placing yourself diagonally above them. There is also a bomb to
  take out multiple enemies. The game has a standard set of pickups: P icons for
  powering the weapons, S icons for increasing ship speed, B icons for bombs, and
  score icons.

  of these are known as the Heavy Nova, a title earned by passing a rigorous
  training regime.
  .
  You are taking on the simulated proving grounds, which are split into two styles
  of alternating action. In the first you must progress (initially purely
  horizontally, though later with vertical flick-scrolling as well) through a
  hostile environment of enemies, bombs and traps, gaining points for doing it
  quickly and with lots of energy left. Initially you can fly and kick as needed.
  .
  Once this section is complete, you move on to one-on-one combat of the Street
  Fighter 2 style. The early foes have far less energy than you begin with. As you
  progress through the game, you are awarded extra attacking moves, in a manner
  similar to Brutal: Paws of Fury

  The official game of the Games of the XXV Olympiad, held in Barcelona in 1992,
  featuring seven different events: 100M Sprint, Hammer Throw, Archery, 110M
  Hurdles, Pole Vault, Springboard diving and 200M Freestyle Swimming.
  .
  Gameplay features the typical button mashing formula used by Epyx during the
  80s. 100M Sprint, 110M Hurdles and 200M Freestyle Swimming feature a button
  mashing sequence with just some changes: in the hurdles the player must hit the
  action key to jump over a hurdle (the timing sets the loss of speed) and in
  swimming, the sequence takes over one and an half minutes and the action button
  touches the edge for the return swim. In these events, the player initially
  faces a semi-final round and only qualifies for the final if ends in the top
  half. It's possible to watch the other semi-final.\n
  Hammer Throw combines a strong mashing sequence, along an accurate press of the
  action button to release the hammer, while Pole Vault combines an initial
  mashing sequence, a first tap on down to set the bar, then pressing up and the
  action button to release the pole and jump over the bar. Archery is a technical
  event where the player has three rounds with six arrows each, the winner being
  the one with the highest score on all three rounds.
  .
  The player can choose to compete for eight nations: Great Britain, France,
  Germany, Italy, hosts Spain, United Stats, Japan and the CIS (formerly the
  Soviet Union). Each nation has it's own sample of the anthem and a set of
  athletes to compete against the player. Each athlete is unique, and will perform
  differently according the the event: in some they are capable of braking World
  Records, in others, lucky enough to get to a final or a top-6 spot. The
  competition is split in two tables: sorted by medals and by total score (the
  gold medalist gets 24 points, the 12th only 13).

  Sonic 3D was the last Sonic title released for the Mega Drive, the only
  platforming presence of the blue blur in the Sega Saturn, and one of his rare
  appearances in Personal Computers. The title, considering the era it was
  released, is somewhat misleading, as instead of full blown 3D graphics it uses
  an isometric view where Sonic can move not only forwards and backwards, but also
  left and right. While visiting Flicky Island, Sonic notices that the Flickies,
  his small, feathered friends that can travel between parallel worlds, were
  captured and turned into badniks (the robot enemies of Sonic) by Dr. Robotnik in
  his never-ending quest for the Chaos Emeralds. Seven levels separate Sonic from
  the final showdown with Robotnik. Gameplay is much slower when compared to other
  games in the series, and the number of badniks is reduced to five in each
  section. As usual, when Sonic destroys one badnik, an animal leaps free from its
  insides, but this time Sonic has to pick him up and lead them to an
  interdimensional ring. While they can be taken one by one, exploring the level
  with all five allow the player to reach for otherwise inaccessible continue
  tokens. Unlike all other previous games, time isn't a requirement: if the player
  completes a level in more than 10 minutes, it would only mean there would be no
  time bonus at the end. Finally, to collect all seven Chaos Emeralds, Sonic first
  must find Tails or Knuckles and offer them at least 50 rings.

  structure, find keys, etc. It is possible to exit a level only after having
  completed the objective. Many missions are timed.

  nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would
  often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming
  the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious
  Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the
  role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.
  .
  Nobunaga's Ambition is a turn-based strategy game which can be played in
  different modes. Gameplay is similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three
  Kingdoms game. Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a
  larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is
  rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and
  IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game.
  The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes
  increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.
  .
  During each of turn (one per season), players can issue one of several commands
  from a menu. They include: Recruiting new soldiers, Training the army, Buying
  Weapons, Increasing Peasant morale, Forming alliances or Hiring Ninjas to bribe
  & assassinate. When one player attacks another, there is a war fought over the
  defender's region. Battles are fought in an overhead-view hex battle map. Each
  player takes turn moving units and issuing orders, which include attack, move,
  bribe and surrender. The goal is to defeat all of the enemy units (or force them
  into surrender). Army units each have a certain weakness against other types of
  enemies, and are also affected by the terrain.

game: Greatest Heavyweights
file: Greatest Heavyweights of the Ring .zip
developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  Greatest Heavyweights is a boxing game featuring the ex heavyweight champions
  Evander Holyfield, Larry Holmes, Joe Frazier, Muhammad Ali, Floyd Patterson,
  Rocky Marciano, Joe Louis and Jack Dempsey. Their likeness and real fighting
  style are simulated by the game.
  .
  The game is an enhanced version of Evander Holyfield's "Real Deal" Boxing, being
  also played in a pseudo-3D side view with moving around the ring handled by
  scrolling the backdrop and moving the ropes. This time, a 2.5D camera is shown
  at the top of the screen.
  .
  There are three game modes:
  .
  1. Exhibition: one or two players can fight a single match.
  .
  2. Tournament: one player chooses among the eight heavyweight champs available
  in a eight-man tournament against the remaining seven.
  .
  3. Career: one player creates a character who starts as the #30 of the ranking,
  fighting his way up against fictional characters. During character creation,
  players can choose the fighter's color of skin (which now includes some
  unnatural colors such as green and blue), trunks and hair, haircut, size of body
  and stats emphasis (power, speed and stamina). Between matches, career mode
  offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats. After
  reaching the #1 in the ranking, the player will be challenged by each one of the
  eight greatest heavyweight champions.
  .
  During the fights, besides an energy bar, the fighters have a head and a torso
  damage meter. This meters are images of their head and torso, which become
  gradually grey, from top to bottom, as they are hit. If one of these meters
  becomes totally grey, it will start blinking, warning that it the fighter takes
  some more punches on that area, he will loose the fight by TKO. Being knocked
  down tree times in a round also leads to a TKO. During the rounds' breaks,
  fighters regain strength as the girl with the round sign passes along their
  sides.
  .
  Fighters can perform three types of punches: jabs, hooks and uppers, which can
  be aimed at the opponent's head or torso. Fighters can also taunt their
  opponents. Each one of the heavyweight champions has his own set of personal
  taunts. If by some reason the fighters avoid to fight, the spectators will start
  to hiss at them. To keep the spectators pleased, the fighters must keep punching
  each other on a regular basis.
  .
  The game plays sensibly faster than Evander Holyfield's, and the character
  animation is more detailed. There's a replay feature included, and the fights
  are announced by Michael Buffer's voice.

description:
  Ayrton Senna won the Monaco Grand Prix six times, as well as 3 Formula One world
  championships, so he was the perfect man to license a home sequel to the classic
  arcade racing game. As before, the action is viewed from within the cockpit, but
  depicted using sprites rather than polygons.
  .
  There are three main modes:
  .
  1. Senna GP: Features three non-championship circuits with a preliminary race
  followed by three laps.
  .
  2. World Championship: The full 16-race championship. There are two modes in the
  championship mode that affect how the game is played. Beginner is a regular
  season, with the same difficulty level as the remaining modes, and cars have
  roughly the same power. Each race has three laps. In Master things get a twist.
  There are five groups of cars, and the player starts on the lowly competitive
  SERGA team. To climb the ranks and get a chance of claim the title the player
  must challenge a driver from other team and beat him to the top spot. The winner
  of this particular race gets (or holds) the fastest car. Races are also longer
  in this mode, and pit-stops are activated, required if the player knocks on too
  many objects or other cars frequently.
  .
  3. Free Practice: This allows the player to drive on any race without caring for
  championship positions. There are two options in Free Practice: Free Run is just
  the player against the clock and Image Training is a race, but instead of having
  to quality and then run the three laps, the player can set the number of laps
  (between one and six), starting position and the condition of the track (dry or
  wet, only on some circuits).
  .
  While each mode presents it's own variations, the core of each race is the same:
  Along controller setup options, the player can choose between an Automatic or
  Manual with 4 or 7 speeds gearbox, and races against 16 drivers. The car can be
  instantly wrecked if it goes on top speed against a roadside object.

  This game features two different modes of play: Classic Battleship and Super
  Battleship.
  .
  Classic Battleship is the typical Battleship game where the players set up their
  ships on a grid, then take turns choosing 3 places at a time to target and hope
  they hit the opposing players ship. The game ends when all the opposing players
  ships are sunk. This mode contains four difficulty levels: Ensign, Lieutenant,
  Commander, and Admiral.
  .
  Super Battleship involves eight levels consisting of sixteen missions total.
  Missions include sinking enemy ships in a certain number of rounds, escorting
  ships to their destinations, defending cities from attack, and destroying enemy
  airfields. Gameplay consists of a turn-based moving of ships utilizing an
  overhead view. The player can then target any enemy units within the ship's
  range and attack. Attacking brings up an action sequence where both ships trade
  volleys of gunfire until one of them either sinks or retreats.

  more, randomized levels and item locations make it a different game every time.
  .
  The game features a dynamic screen splitting - screen joining 2-player mode.\n
  Players start the game close to each other. If one gets away from the other, the

  NHLPA licenses in NHL '94, allowing them to feature all 26 real teams (including
  both expansion teams) and players of the new NHL season for the first time in
  the series.
  .
  Aside from the licenses, the gameplay for this edition sees for the first time
  the inclusion of the devastating one-timer shot, but to keep forwards
  (literally) in check, defenders also feature harder body checks, with new
  animations. For an additional challenge, players can also choose to control the
  goalkeeper manually. A popular feature in previous editions, fighting is
  completely removed from the game. Game modes include exhibition games (or
  "regular season" in-game), playoffs (best of one or best of seven) and an all
  new shoot-out mode. The main options remain basically the same couple since the
  establishment of the series - period length (5, 10 or 20 minutes), line changes
  (off, manual or the new automatic mode) and penalties. (off, on, on but no
  offsides).
  .
  While there are some minor differences between platforms (Genesis  features
  record keeping for users and the MegaCD version has more stat screens, CD
  quality audio backdrops and the usual highlight clips here and there), only the

description:
  The sequel to Winter Challenge, this Summer edition includes 8 events from
  athletics to cycling. The events are:
  .
  1. Kayak: The player goes on a downhill stream, and must navigate through gates
  without missing or touching them (unlike the real event, there are no reverse
  gates), as well as avoiding to hit the margins of the stream. Pushing forward
  paddles, pressing a direction along a button allows a sharper turn. The winner
  is the one with the fastest time after penalty time is added\n
  2. Archery: Each competitor has four targets, each with three arrows. By moving
  the directional buttons the player moves the erratic crosshair, while pressing a
  button fires the arrow.\n
  3. 400m Hurdles: The player does a full lap on the track by pressing the first
  button to set the pace and the second to jump. Mistiming the jump either makes
  the athlete knock the hurdle and lose a few tenths of second, or goes completely
  off-balance and falls, ending the event\n
  4. High Jump and Pole Vault: Two similar events where the player starts by
  setting the bar height, and then mashing the power button to build enough speed.
  Then, just before the jump point the action button must be pressed and held
  until the athlete is in position to pass over the bar. The contest ends once
  there are three misses at an height, or the maximum height is cleared.\n
  5. Equestrian: The most technical event, the player must steer the horse to the
  best trajectory while jumping over hurdles and walls. While a knockdown means a
  time penalty in the end, if the horse refuses to do a jump (if the button is
  pressed too soon or too late) the competition ends immediately.\n
  6. Javelin: A simple event where each player has three attempts to launch the
  javelin as far as possible. To do so, first some speed must be built, and a few
  steps before the mark start pressing the action button to start the launch
  sequence, which initiates the angle measure. Once the player releases the button
  (ideally at an angle between 40 and 45 degrees next to the mark), the javelin is
  released as well\n
  7. Cycling: In this sprint event the player must complete a number of laps in
  the velodrome, while keeping as fast and as close as possible to the inner edge
  without falling.
  .
  Like with Winter Challenge, graphically, the game features the same polygonal
  environments with bitmap athletes and game modes include the ability to train or
  compete in a tournament (up to eight human players, with three computer levels
  and 16 nations to choose from). It's also possible to replay and even store your
  best (or worst) moments.

  using your biological sonar and of course, jumping out of the water to amaze
  your friends.
  .
  The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box
  illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a
  giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on
  your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will
  be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with
  the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat
  the Vortex Queen.

  for inexperienced coaches. The nature of the gameplay is very "arcade-like". The
  game doesn't have GM functions, players statistics, player attributes,
  substitutions or any other coaching options. Just choose your scheme and execute
  it.

  On the defensive side you can control any player you want, on the attack you
  control either the quarterback, a receiver, a running back or the kicker.

game: Sonic The Hedgehog 2
file: Sonic The Hedgehog 2 .zip
developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed, and the
  sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog. Players run through different worlds called
  "Zones", each with a specific theme. There are two Acts in nearly all of the 10
  Zones, and at the end of each Zone's last Act is a machine that Robotnik
  controls, which you must defeat to progress. Sonic and Tails can collect rings
  which are scattered throughout all of the levels. When the player collects 100
  rings they earn an extra life. The rings also act as protection - if Sonic is
  hurt when he is carrying rings, they scatter everywhere and he is briefly
  invincible. If he is hit again when he has no rings, he'll lose a life. If the
  player reaches a continue point lamppost with 50 or more rings, they'll be able
  to access the Special Stage. In this stage, you must gather a set amount of
  rings in a halfpipe-like stage before you reach a checkpoint. Complete all the
  checkpoints and you'll earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds. The game also
  includes the ability to play the game co-op with a friend - at any time, a
  player can plug in a second controller and take over the AI controlled Tails.
  Tails has infinite lives and the camera remains focused on Sonic, meaning that
  Tails will not hinder play. Sonic (and Tails) can now also get speed from a
  standing start by holding down and repeatedly pressing the jump button for a
  "Spin Dash". This is useful when stuck near steep slopes or other areas where
  you need some momentum. The game also features a 2-player versus mode. This mode
  is a horizontally split-screen race through levels based on three of the zones
  in the single player game.

description:
  Bubble and Squeak starts off similarly to many other platform games. Controlling
  a bald child, you move through a scrolling array of ledges, avoiding contact
  with nasties who release coins when shot. There are hidden areas to find as
  well.
  .
  Halfway through the first of the 30 levels, you meet Squeak and the full nature
  of the game starts. Squeak is a blue alien, who must also be guided through the
  levels. As he can't jump as high as you, he must sometimes be instructed to wait
  while you flick a switch or otherwise solve the puzzle of how to guide him
  through. If you stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an extra-high
  jump.
  .
  Bubble Mode is an equivalent of Super Mario mode - it allows you to jump higher,
  run faster and shoot more lethal weaponry (bubbles in this case). It is
  activated by placing a coin into a Bubblegum machine, and then jumping on
  Squeak's back.
  .
  In between the main platform levels there are side-view shoot 'em up sections
  taking place underwater – completing these earns bonuses.

  A key feature of NBA Jam was the exaggerated nature of the play - players jumped
  many times above their own height, making slam dunks that defied both human
  capabilities and the laws of physics. There were no fouls, free throws, or
  violations except goaltending and 24 second violations. This meant the player
  was able to freely shove or elbow his opponent out of the way. Additionally, the
  game had an "on fire" feature, where if one player made three baskets in a row,
  he would become "on fire" and have unlimited turbo, no goaltending, and
  increased shooting ability, until the other team scored (or the player had
  scored four consecutive baskets while "on fire").

  that loop around other rides.

  Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and
  souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to
  maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running
  smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

  over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability
  closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that
  research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

developer: Lankhor
publisher: Lankhor
description:
  Kawasaki Superbike Challenge is a motorcycle racing game that uses the same
  engine as F1. It includes 14 standard-length race tracks, plus the Suzuka 8
  Hours endurance race, available in both training and Championship modes. The
  game is unlicensed (except by Kawasaki), so all riders and teams are fictional.
  .
  The game now has more polygonal roadside objects than F1, and there is still a
  Turbo mode, allowing for faster racing at the expense of some of the detail. You
  have the ability to turn on or off weather (during rainy days the graphics are
  darker and the bike has less traction). The number of laps on each course can be
  5, 10 or 15, and there are 4 skill levels. Some changes have been made to how
  the vehicle handles, to emphasize the switch from cars to bikes.

game: King's Bounty - The Conqueror's Quest
file: King's Bounty .zip
developer: Electronic Arts
publisher: Electronic Arts
description:
  As a knight, paladin, barbarian or sorceress, amass an army of creatures to take
  on the local baddies and search for the Sceptre of Order.  A turn based game
  with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.
  .
  Depending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of
  creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian.
  Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner
  opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy
  some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.
  .
  You can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of
  enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected
  after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied
  by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two
  level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the
  castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the
  other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no
  matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you
  can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have
  enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.
  .
  There are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the
  place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it
  back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in
  the game.
  .
  As for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and
  demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go.
  But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with
  almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left
  without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid
  him as every week the population increases.

game: Valis - The Fantasm Soldier
file: Valis .zip
developer: Renovation Products
publisher: Renovation Products
description:
  Yuko Asou is an ordinary Japanese teenager with an ordinary life - until one day
  she is attacked by a monster on the street. Out of nowhere, a sword appears in
  her hands. She fights the monsters who have suddenly invaded the city, and is
  summoned to the parallel world known as Vecanti, which is ruled by a cruel
  tyrant named Rogles, whose actions disrupt the balance of the the worlds.
  Wielding the legendary Valis sword, Yuko must defeat Rogles and restore the
  balance.
  .
  Valis has the same story and basic genre (platform action) as the  original
  first game in the  series; however, it is a different game with different
  locations, regular enemies and bosses, new cut scenes, etc.  Defeating the
  numerous enemies populating the game world requires precise usage of jumping and
  ducking abilities, and attack timing. Yuko can jump very high and attack while
  jumping. Various power-ups are scattered through the game, many of which enhance
  the performance of Yuko's sword. Acting as a melee weapon in the beginning, it
  can be customized with power-ups and turn into a medium-range weapon, firing
  shots at the enemies - with proper power-ups, also in different directions. Boss
  enemies typically have different attack patterns and require different
  strategies to defeat them.

  Similar to its predecessor, the premise of After Burner II is to get on the F-14
  Tomcat and fly mission after mission of shooting planes out of the sky. At your
  disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of
  missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time.
  Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you
  can replenish your missiles.
  .
  The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of
  enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you
  spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow
  down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.

  STORY\n
  The European Wars against Spain and France have been costly to the British
  Empire. In order to gain additional funds for the war effort, the Crown raise
  taxes from the New World colonies without representation. This act compels the
  New World colonies to protest and boycott against British rule. By 1775, the
  Crown alarmed by the protests, boycotts and politically instability in the New
  World sends troops to subdue any rebellious efforts by the New World colonists.
  This threatening approach provokes the Thirteen Colonies to revolt. Thus starts
  the War for Independence in the New World (American Revolutionary War).
  .
  GAMEPLAY\n
  Choosing Sides\n
  In Liberty or Death, you partake in the American Revolutionary War, either as
  the "rebels" - the American Continental Army or as the "Crown" - the British
  Royal Army.
  .
  Choosing either one of the nations will prompt you to choose the leading
  Commander-in-Chief:
  .
  The Continental Army: Charles Lee, Artemas Ward or George Washington.\n
  The British Royal Army: Henry Clinton, Thomas Gage or William Howe.
  .
  Revolutionary Politics\n
  Each turn you will have to balance your treasury for the war effort. Money is
  provided by each state. The more states that support your cause, the more money
  will flow in your coffers. Money is spent in paying wages, strengthening the
  fleet and recruiting new regiments.
  .
  Here, if you have a sufficient fleet, you can also command your Navy officer to
  "control the seas" which is conducting a blockade and privateering against enemy
  ships. This may result in seized goods that will be added to your treasury.
  .
  The American Revolutionary War in Liberty or Death included everyone except the
  American Indians: [1] Revolutionary Militia: American supporters but not yet
  fully supportive of Continental Army (not under your full control) [2] Loyalist
  Militia: Militia supportive to the Crown [3] French Army: The French will
  support the American cause after a formal alliance is held. [4] Spanish Army:
  The Spaniards will support the American cause after a formal alliance is held.
  .
  Revolutionary Combat\n
  The Top-down turned based combat introduces units available in the Revolutionary
  War: Infantry, Guerrilla, Cavalry and Artillery (Engineers). Combat near shores
  may also be joined by Naval units: Fleet and Fires Ships.

  positioning and timing are crucial to avoid hitting the ball outside the court,
  swinging the racket into thin air or more embarrassing, let the ball hit you on
  the head.\n
  Three courts are available: Grass, Clay and Indoor (Sega versions  add a fourth,
  Hard), but the differences between them are minimal. Game modes change according
  to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a "Skins" game, where each

  Top Fighter 2000 MK VIII is a fighting game created for the Mega Drive,
  presumably in the year 2000 by an unknown company. It features 8 characters from
  many different places and sources, including real-life personalities such as
  Michael Jordan and Muhammad Ali.
  .
  This is a fighting game with 8 opponents and no repeats between them. Each
  character has their own special moves and one super move, along with 8
  backgrounds that are not character specific. The backgrounds are cobbled
  together using elements of backgrounds found in several different games,
  including World Heroes, Street Fighter II, The King of Fighters '95, and Fatal
  Fury 2. The controls appear to be somewhat better than other Mega Drive pirated
  fighting games, such as Tekken 3 Special. However, the A button is unused,
  leaving B and C to be used for all attacks, similar to a NES fighting pirate.
  .
  Each fight lasts until one fighter wins 1 or 3 rounds and each round can last
  for up to 30, 60 or 99 seconds, depending on the settings. The hit detection is
  poor, with many attacks that miss the opponent when they're supposed to hit
  them. The endings are minimal, with a portrait of your character on a simple
  "YOU ARE BEST. GAME OVER" (sic) screen.

  Fighting Masters is an early one-on-one fighter with limited controls. Three
  buttons are available in the game: block, attack and jump. The D-pad cannot be
  used to jump directly. Instead, the player has to walk in a certain direction
  and then press the jump key to perform it. Although there are no combos
  available, the attack key offers different moves and a few special moves are
  available as well. Most of the fighting leads to holds from which massive damage
  can be inflicted by dropping the opponent or throwing him against the wall.
  Twelve different fighters have available. Aside from the moves, some are also
  faster or come with more powerful attacks. The game modes include matches for
  one or two players and a watch mode to view a computer-computer fight.

description:
  In this game you play the role of a surfer called Greendog who discovers a gold
  pendant while out surfing. Unwittingly he puts the pendant on and discovers it
  wont come off. A bikini clad girl tells him that the pendant was made by the
  Aztecs long ago, and that they cursed it so that whoever wears it will be
  attacked by any animal that comes near them. Worst of all the person wearing it
  is unable to surf. The only way Greendog can lift the curse and remove the
  pendant is to find the six pieces of Aztec treasure and put them all together
  and the only knowledge of the whereabouts of the treasure is stamped on the back
  of the pendant.
  .
  The gameplay involves you getting from the left end of the level to the right

  bonus areas still remains. Controls are also modified; only the C button allows
  Sonic to jump and A shoots fireballs (if Sonic has grabbed a Fire Flower.)

  spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many

publisher: Beam Software
description:
  Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where
  players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds
  against different boxers to win the championship title belt.
  .
  Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the
  shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming
  punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross,
  but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.
  .
  By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available,
  inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of
  three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over
  (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a
  single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch
  buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an
  energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and
  during intermissions, some energy is restored.
  .
  All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A
  password system is used to save the progress.

description:
  A fast-paced platform game in the vein of the classic Sonic the Hedgehog. The
  evil overlord Time Dominator has constructed a time machine and is using it to
  steal treasures from the past, creating a warp in the flow of time. The Time
  Warp Patrol, created to prevent this sort of thing from happening, sends the
  special time-traveling duck Socket (or Minutes in the Japanese version) to fix
  the flow of time and stop Time Dominator.
  .
  Socket has reasonably basic abilities: he can jump, kick to the side or straight
  upward, and run quite fast. As Socket is a robot, his energy level continually
  drains from simply being in operation; thankfully, there are a liberal amount of
  electric bolts strewn about each stage, which will refill his health when picked
  up. Getting hit by enemies will take a chunk out of his life bar.
  .
  There are seven different themed zones, each with four separate parts. First up
  is the High Speed Zone, which is a gateway level leading to the next zone, and
  as the name suggests it encourages high speed play. Next is the Athletic Zone,
  which generally entails lots of jumping, and the Labyrinth Zone, which is
  focused on exploration and simply finding a path to the exit. At the end of each
  Labyrinth Zone, Socket faces off against Time Dominator in a boss round, then
  moves on to the next High Speed Zone.
  .
  The game also features a sound test mode and a time trial mode, where the High
  Speed Zone stages can be played without any enemies present with times being
  recorded.

  missiles. The four stages all follow a similar pattern: the first part is from a
  perspective behind your helicopter where you not only have to dodge enemy fire
  but also obstacles like buildings or caves. In between, face off against one or
  two smaller boss enemies. When the first part of a level is finished, the view
  switches to an overhead perspective for the confrontation with the level end
  boss.

  Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit

  between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate
  through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and
  activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a
  sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump
  and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just
  one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also
  traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump,
  duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit
  points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level
  (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to

  Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too

  seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of\n
  isometric death await.
  .
  The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by
  encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard.
  To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As
  frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances
  annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what
  challenge lies in the next room.
  .
  The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items;
  you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises
  with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through
  a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The
  dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade
  items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a
  special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he
  executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the
  left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save
  option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you
  like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.

developer: Electronic Arts
publisher: Electronic Arts
description:
  In the future, the world is controlled by a handful of global corporations
  (syndicates).  You are the Marketing director (hit man) for one of these
  companies.  It is your job to take control away from the competitors.  The job
  is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control.  Advance
  your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions
  and managing the money you make from your territories.
  .
  The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down
  perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions
  ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you
  direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything
  that gets in their way.
  .
  You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you
  have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates.  As you complete
  missions, you gain more funds to use for purchasing agents or researching
  upgrades and equipment.

  the same time by pressing the main attack buttons. Although the visuals are less
  rough and friendlier than its contemporary counterparts, the difficulty is very
  unforgiving. DJ Boy has only four life bars and when they are gone, the game is
  over without continues. Defeated enemies leave behind coins. At the end of each
  stage the coins can be exchanged for a skateboard, a stronger punch or other

  the country´s most fearsome cop and hunts his nemesis, Simon Phoenix. However in
  doing so, he kills several innocent civilians and both characters are sentenced
  to cryostasis rehabilitation where they will be brainwashed for 30 years.
  However the brainwashing does not go as planned and upon waking up, Phoenix goes
  on a new crime spree. However in 30 years the world has also changed and Los
  Angeles has become San Angeles, a utopian and violence-free society. As a
  remnant of a more violent past, police officer John Spartan is once again sent
  to capture Phoenix.
  .
  Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with some levels taking place in
  an overhead perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John Spartan, the player will
  spend most of his time shooting endless waves of "cryocons" released upon the
  antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a
  shotgun and magnum, both with limited ammo. Additionally, various types of
  grenades can be collected, which are thrown independently of the firearm. Simon
  Phoenix appears as a boss character at the end of every level that is directly
  tied in with the movie.

  digitized clips from the film to introduce levels and advance the plot.

developer: Virgin
publisher: Virgin
description:
  First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet
  (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army).
  The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which
  can be completed in any other, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its
  own surprises.
  .
  Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use
  whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go
  to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can
  freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles.
  .
  Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for
  better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put
  protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser
  turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will
  build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.
  .
  Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to
  dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area
  you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll
  start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level
  up then the at previous level.
  .
  If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush
  the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what
  its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same
  level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy
  soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.
  .
  The main thing as it always is in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and
  lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your
  men, making a perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes...
  to dominate the world and crush your opponents.
  .
  You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your
  men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of
  age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.

  green). Player names, on the other hand, were made by mixing names found on real
  squads. Portuguese teams, for instance, had a large number of Yugoslavian
  players in the early 1990s, and that was reflected by players with names such as
  Valentim Ivic (of Valentim Loureiro and Tomislav Ivic, then Boavista FC chairman

  the game lacked a battery, it does not store changes done to kits and passwords
  were used to resume tournaments (example of a password sheet). Rotherham United
  are included amongst the English clubs despite never playing in the top tier of

  Having vanquished the evil crime empire, Neo Zeed, the ninja master Shinobi and
  his combat ninja skills were not heard from for some time. But a new threat
  arose, in a reptilian form that lived on vicious instinct alone. The colossal
  monster moved slowly and quietly, and its attack was relentless. The souls
  unfortunate enough to survive became hostages, and mass panic swept the streets.

  It remained only for Shinobi to take action. His weapons were stealth and
  quickness of attack, his only allies facing overwhelming forces. Relying on
  Ninja weapons and magic, Shinobi fought on, assisted by his faithful dog.

  Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi is similar to Shadow Dancer for home

  there are a few differences between the two. For example, in this Sega
  Genesis/Mega Drive exclusive, the stages are different, and you rescue hostages
  rather than disarm bombs.  Each mission ends up with you fighting a boss, and
  when you defeat each (except the final one), you also participate in a bonus
  stage where you must shoot all ninja flying towards you.

  in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of
  the console allow).
  .
  The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were
  digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive,
  driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match
  and Shootout), as well as a replay.
  .
  Gameplaywise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to
  start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's
  possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and
  pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a
  bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit
  areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in
  pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However,
  only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice
  levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.

game: Alien Storm
file: Alien Storm.zip
developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the "Alien Busters" to wipe them
  out and destroy their creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and
  Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.
  .
  When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as.
  There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several
  stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from
  the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens.
  Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get
  tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants,
  postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective
  such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.
  .
  When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot
  to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours
  get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you
  can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see.
  These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of
  the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs
  across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present
  location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will
  then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of
  energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.
  .
  At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to
  complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings
  where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens
  popping up from several locations with the building.
  .
  You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.

  Red Zone is a helicopter action shooter in which you pilot an AH-64B Apache into
  the heart of enemy territory to thwart the plans of a nuclear armed dictator.
  Under threat of global nuclear war the dictator has begun to annex his neighbor
  countries, with plans to continue his territorial expansion, so three special
  operatives are covertly sent in with a lone gunship to remove his ability to
  wage war.
  .
  The majority of the game consists of air-to-ground attack while flying in the
  Apache, using its hefty loadout of rockets, guided missiles, built-in 30 mm
  cannon and defensive infrared air-to-air missiles in order to eliminate the
  hostiles from the air, land and sea.  Fuel drums, repair kits and ammunition
  depletion are both factors to keep in mind, and careful planning of where the
  pickups are located so that the chopper is able to stay in the air and is able
  to keep fighting, elements that are very similar in implementation to the Strike
  series.  Differences between the games include the fact that as your systems get
  damaged, your helicopter becomes harder to control and the weapon and radar
  systems become affected.
  .
  Interspersed with the plentiful in-chopper combat, there are numerous
  mission-oriented sequences in which the occupants of the helicopter disembark
  and perform missions on-foot inside of buildings.  Each of the three characters
  have a unique set of weapons, and the player can choose from either of the three
  to use, so long as none of them have been killed during previous on-foot
  missions.
  .
  Red Zone bears many gameplay similarities to the early entries of the Strike
  series of games, though while the first three games of that series had a fixed
  isometric point-of-view, Red Zone has a straight-down POV that rotates along
  with the helicopter.  Red Zone is also highly reminiscent of Zyrinx's earlier
  and similarly technologically advanced Genesis game Sub-Terrania, with the most
  notable similarities being in the relative difficulty of the games, and in the
  manipulation of the Genesis' hardware into providing visual effects not seen in
  other games, such as simulated video.

  In the first Uncharted Waters game, it was the 15th century and the New World
  was discovered. Now in New Horizons, it is the early 16th century and the age of
  exploration and sea trade is underway. Players choose from any one of six
  adventurers (scenarios), each with their own distinctive but intertwining plot,
  to embark on a quest of sailing, seamanship and exploration. The six characters
  are:
  .
  1. Joao Franco is the son of Duke Leon Franco, the hero of the first Uncharted
  Waters game and an influential man in Portugal. His father wants to make him
  into a strong man and so decides to send him out to sea. Young Joao is tasked
  with learning the skills of the sailor (he is the only character who starts at
  level one) and embarking on a quest of discovery; reaching the far east and
  eventually looking for the secret of Atlantis.
  .
  2. Catalina Erantzo is a Spanish naval officer who believes her beloved and her
  brother were both murdered by the Portuguese armada. Vowing revenge she turns to
  a life of piracy and soon becomes a red haired scourge of the seas.
  .
  3. Pietro Conti is a indebted man, having inherited the financial woes of the
  Conti family. When the Duchess Franco hires him to spy on her son, he accepts
  the job and obtains a ship. Pietro hopes to use these resources to seek out
  valuable treasure and clear up his family's debt.
  .
  4. Ernst Von Bohr is a geographer who is teaching classes in Holland. But he
  yearns to leave the classroom and sail the high seas, living a life of adventure
  that he has only read about in books. When his friend, Mercator offers to
  finance his initial voyage in exchange for cartography information about the
  world, Ernst is given the opportunity to live out his dream.
  .
  5. Ali Vezas is a poor orphaned child living in Istanbul and serving others. He
  dreams of becoming his own master and making his own fortune across foreign
  lands. A twist of fate aides in providing him with small loans, with which he is
  able to afford his first ship and sail out with a cargo hold full of goods...
  .
  6. Otto Baynes styles himself a Royal Knight of the British Empire, in the
  service of his majesty the king. Promoted to Admiral of the British fleet, the
  kingdom is worried about the increased naval power of Spanish fleets. Otto is
  given a letter of marque by the king and ordered to terrorize the Spanish Fleet.
  Equipping himself simply at first, Otto strives to become a great Privateer in
  the name of King and Country.
  .
  Regardless of the character chosen, Uncharted Waters: New Horizons is a top-down
  sailing simulation. At sea, players control the direction of their ship, where
  speed is affected by the number/health of the crew, the wind and the currents.
  Players can navigate anywhere there is water (though some ships are not ocean
  worthy) and discover interesting landmarks and new ports. Upon landing at a
  port, the view is also top-down and the player can enter different buildings,
  each with unique services and goods. These include: The Inn, the Item Shop, The
  Shipyard, The Tavern, The Castle, The Guild Hall, The Church, The Merchant and
  the Harbor. It's up to the player to earn enough gold to keep the crew fed and
  financed and keep the fleet repaired. Primary methods of earning money are
  through sea trade, accepting jobs from the guild, gambling and battle with other
  ships.
  .
  During naval combat, the game becomes a turn-based top-down strategy game, with
  the player moving ships in order to obtain trajectories needed to fire cannons
  at enemy ships, or run alongside enemy vessels in order to board them. If the
  player's flagship attacks the flagship of the enemy fleet, they can challenge
  the opponent to a duel. If accepted, the game changes to a side-view of the two
  captains engaged in a fight. During this sequence, the player can only choose
  which fighting maneuver (strike, thrust, parry, lash) they wish to engage in.

  with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the
  screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The
  available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and
  the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.
  .
  The plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by,
  scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge
  systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.

developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  The Romulans request permission to enter the Neutral Zone in order to search for
  a team of their researchers that they claim has gone missing. The USS Enterprise
  is sent to monitor their activities and find out their real motives.
  .
  Gameplay is divided into three parts: commanding the Enterprise from the bridge,
  controlling an away team on a planetary mission and combat with other ships.
  .
  From the bridge you can control all of the ships main functions. Conn: Set
  course to a different planet or sector. Communication:  Communicate: with other
  ships. Sensors: Receive information on your surroundings or planets you are
  orbiting. Computer: Access a database that contains lots of information on
  planets, races, technology, your crew etc. Engineering: If the Enterprise got
  damaged during combat, you can use this command to allocate resources to the
  different parts of the ship that need to be repaired. Briefing Room: Receive
  orders and information on your current mission. Tactical Station: Engage in
  combat. Transporter: Assemble an away team and beam it down to a planet (which
  is only possible if your current mission requires it).
  .
  Before starting an away mission, you have to assemble a team of four crew
  members that differ in strength and in tactical and technical ability. Some crew
  members also have special abilities, Dr. Crusher can heal other crew members,
  Geordi and Data can see in the dark and Data can survive without air. Away
  missions are shown from a top-down perspective and you can control each team
  member individually or order different members to follow your currently selected
  character around. Most away missions are a mixture of simple (real time) combat
  and puzzle solving that usually consists getting hints from tricorder readings
  and finding objects that have to be used in the correct way.
  .
  Ship battles are also seen from a top-down perspective and let you attack enemy
  ships with phasers and photon torpedoes, while keeping an eye or your shields
  and trying to dodge you enemy's torpedoes. If your ship too heavily damaged you
  can surrender and hope that your enemy spares you.
  .
  While the SNES and Genesis versions are essentially the same games, there are
  some noticeable differences. The Genesis version plays considerably faster
  during ship battles and on away missions as well as on the bridge (meaning it
  takes much less time to repair the ship). There are many graphical differences
  and the map layout for away missions is slightly different from the SNES version
  as well.

  For a long time, our world was in darkness. The sun shone as always, but our
  souls were dark and lacked the true enlightenment. Then the holy Nexus arrived,
  and changed everything. With his Rod of Creation, he blessed the people with the
  gift of the six Arts. The Red Priests - the people he chose among the others -
  established an order of the six Guilds. The world entered the era of prosperity.
  But the evil demon Void stole the Rod of Creation and drove the world to chaos
  again. In a cosmic battle, Nexus faced Void. None was victorious, and the Rod of
  Power was broken during the battle. It was divided into eleven rings, known as
  the Rings of Power. The young sorcerer Buc is now sent on a quest to retrieve
  those rings, and to unite the Rod of Power that will eventually banish Void
  forever!
  .
  "Rings of Power" is quite different from traditional console RPGs gameplay-wise,
  and is more similar to Western-style games such as  Ultima series. You can
  freely wander through the huge isometric world, and are not obliged to follow
  any storyline except the main quest for the eleven rings. You can talk to NPCs
  about many topics, choose whom to fight, bribe people, etc. There is a day/night
  cycle which affects the behavior of characters. Unlike most RPGs, there are no
  weapons and armor in this game. The turn-based combat is entirely dependent on
  magic spells. On your journey you will encounter characters from several guilds,
  each proficient in his own type of magic, and make them join your party.

game: The Lawnmower Man

developer: Time Warner Interactive
publisher: Time Warner Interactive
description:
  The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself
  loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce
  Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries
  in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of
  primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training.
  .
  With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the
  chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation,
  and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he
  notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs
  such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly
  increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the
  experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the
  drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the
  treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take
  revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to
  take over all computers in the world.
  .
  While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both
  cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or
  Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting
  action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after
  collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives
  protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the
  movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.
  .
  The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences
  of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional
  shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual
  World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different
  approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging
  obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to
  Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person
  and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel
  with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).

description:
  This cartridge combines two different localized flavours of the original arcade
  game. There are two modes, Grind Stormer and V Five. Both offers the same levels
  and enemies, but have a different approach to how the player can use power-ups.
  .
  In this hectic, top-down, vertically-scrolling shooter where the screen is
  constantly filled with enemies and bullets, players have a constant, unlimited
  firing rate, enhanced by power-ups that include missiles, target-seeking
  bullets, shields, additional speed, extra power and bonus points. In Grind
  Stormer the ship always moves at a fast speed and the player can collect bombs
  that damage the entire screen and fend off bullets. The other variant V Five
  takes a Gradius-approach to power-ups, having the player advance through a
  selection of power-ups shown on the right by collecting tokens. In the first
  mode power-ups are immediately applied. In the second mode the ship is much
  slower and the player needs to decide to spend tokens on speed power-ups right
  away or save them to advance to seeking bullets or additional power.

  The game difficulty, amount of lives and continues can be set in the options.
  After using a continue, the player immediately receives a "Special" power-up

  There are many improvements to the gameplay: Jay can shoot while jumping and
  shoot diagonally upwards with certain weapons. At the beginning of each mission,
  you can pick a special weapon such as a laser rifle, bazooka, flamethrower or
  grenades. You have to choose carefully as they cannot be reused in later
  missions. You can still hide in doorways and recharge your weapons behind
  special doors. The mission timer from the previous game has been replaced by a
  sniper that targets you with a crosshair when you don't move fast enough. The
  brutal difficulty from the previous games has been toned down: there are more
  life marks at the start and you now resurrect where you died, rather than
  returning to the last checkpoint. Unlike the previous game, you can only choose
  one character to play with.

  of.
  .
  The game is a side scrolling shooter of sorts. You control a large mech (robot)
  which has a smaller side-kick mech which is a bit like a car. The two can join
  together providing an alternate shooting mode. Whilst controlling just the main
  mech however, the player can shoot both forward and back by using different
  buttons. The mech can also use it's rocket pack to boost off of the ground and
  hover for a short while. Levels are not necessarily left to right moving
  (although for the most part they are) and the game is an interesting blend of
  platform game and shoot-em-up.
  .
  The game features innovative graphics given the hardware limitations - there is
  a 3D introduction to most levels (remembering that the console had no 3D
  capability and a tile-based renderer) and some levels use a line-based scrolling
  effect to give the impression of 3D backgrounds.

developer: Sunsoft
publisher: Sunsoft
description:
  The Genesis version of Batman: The Video Game follows closely the plot from the
  1989 movie.
  .
  The game consists in six stages, four of side-scrolling platform action and two
  side-scrolling shooter ones, in the following order: Gotham City Street, Axis
  Chemical Factory, Flugelheim Museum, Gotham City Street (with the Batmobile and
  after that on foot), In the Sky over Gotham City (with the Batwing) and the
  Cathedral, where Batman finally faces the Joker.
  .
  Batman can beat his enemies by punching them, slide kicking (by pressing down
  and the B button) or throwing his Batarang. By holding down the B button, Batman
  will block projectile-based attacks. He can also use his double jump (pressing
  the C button a second time while ascending) to leap greater distances or attack
  his enemies. To reach higher platforms, Batman can use his Grappling Hook (by
  pressing up and C to shoot, C again to climb). While piloting the Batmobile or
  the Batwing, Batman can shoot the Twin Vulcan Cannons (B button) or Twin Homing
  Missiles (A button).
  .
  Through the levels, Batman will collect Batman emblems (which will give him
  Batarangs or Twin Homing Missiles, depending on the stage played), Hearts (which
  give him health) and Batman heads (which give him an extra life).

description:
  A follow-up to the original Math Blaster! games, Math Blaster: In Search of Spot
  is an educational title with arcade elements designed to help students learn
  maths while having fun.
  .
  The game allows students to practice basic addition, subtraction,
  multiplication, and division skills in addition to fractions, decimals,
  percents, estimation, and number patterns. The subjects can be practiced
  separately or together in review. Six levels of difficulty are provided. Like
  the previous titles, the game also includes an editor to create new problem sets
  (present in the PC version only).
  .
  Math Blaster's friend and assistant, Spot, is kidnapped by the evil Trash Alien
  at the beginning of the game. The Galactic Commander gives Math Blaster the
  mission to follow the Trash Alien to his home planet and rescue Spot.
  .
  The game starts with a complete mission (story mode). The mission consists of a
  series of four (three in the console versions) math activities (mini-games)
  strung together with cut-scenes. The activities can also be played separately,
  for practice or for score.
  .
  The activities are as follows:
  .
  1. Trash Zapper - Solve equations to gain tractor beam power, then use the
  tractor beam to collect space trash.
  .
  2. Number Recycler (PC version only) - Create equations by pushing around
  columns of numbers and operators. Correct equations allow you to turn the trash
  you collected into fuel.
  .
  3. Cave Runner - Use Math Blaster's jet pack to fly through a cave. He has a
  number on his chest, and it must be arithmetically between the numbers on each
  side of an opening in order for him to pass through. Droplets of water falling
  from above can change this number by performing an operation on it. There are
  also gems which can be collected for bonus points, and in higher levels,
  monsters appear that can knock Math Blaster down.
  .
  4. Math Blaster - The Trash Alien's spaceship displays an equation, and the four
  portholes serve as multiple-choice answers. Use the jet pack to fly into the
  correct portholes while avoiding floating trash and energy blasts from the ship.
  Bonus gems also appear at random, and after five problems a bonus round occurs
  where players get a chance to collect as many gems as they can within a time
  limit.
  .
  Upon finishing the complete mission, the player is presented with a certificate
  that can be printed out (PC version only). Their final score is also added to a
  high score board for their account.

  Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and
  prove his innocence.  Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty
  that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired

  As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter
  based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through
  future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human
  resistance.
  .
  Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate
  (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers
  in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage.
  Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the
  machine guns, and are shot to be collected.
  .
  T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general
  concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns
  down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a
  besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy
  supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time
  to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet
  research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend
  off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.
  .
  Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold
  Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final

developer: Sega

description:
  Sonic the Hedgehog is the first of many games starring Sega's premier rodent
  Sonic. It's a side scrolling platform game with a difference: speed. Sonic
  rushes through levels with incredible speed, allowing him to traverse loops and
  jumps with ease. The evil Dr. Robotnik has captured many of Sonic's animal
  friends and trapped them inside robots. Sonic can free his friends by destroying
  the robots with his spin attack. Meanwhile, Dr. Robotnik is trying to control
  the all-powerful chaos emeralds and Sonic must grab them before he does in the
  3D rotating bonus levels. Sonic's weapon is his spin attack; while jumping,
  Sonic destroys hostile robots by touch. Throughout the platforming levels Sonic
  collects numerous rings. If Sonic is hit by an enemy, all the rings he's
  carrying fall out and scatter around; Sonic can quickly grab the rings back
  before they disappear. If Sonic is hit while not carrying any rings, he dies.
  Collecting 100 rings gives Sonic an extra life. There is also an invincibility
  bonus which temporarily protects Sonic from all attacks. The game is divided
  into several "zones", each of them containing three levels. At the end of each
  zone Sonic confronts Dr. Robotnik in a boss fight. Sonic the Hedgehog is a
  significant game because it gave Sega it's first real mascot, and established
  the Genesis as the video game system with "attitude."

game: Columns

developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
description:
  Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks
  in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3
  same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3
  or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5
  count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The
  real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so
  as to create other lines.
  .
  As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim
  is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of
  bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of
  complete rows which are already in place.

  The sequel to one of the most famous games ever now has a much more significant

  own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus
  and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10
  levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman
  from the 12 pieces.
  .
  Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in
  use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones form the original and is
  perhaps the best option for first-time players.
  .
  The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards)
  and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to
  produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various
  methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who
  can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their
  exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any
  combination of skills and experiment.
  .
  Unlike the first game, you are rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible,
  rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60
  Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe -
  Silver and Bronze are also on offer. You can also go back over levels in the
  hope of saving more Lems.
  .
  Because there are 12 tribes, and you can switch between them at any point, you
  have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves your
  progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.

  role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A.
  Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a

  well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs,
  crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion
  and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with
  normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil
  slicks and stray cows.
  .
  By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with
  which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit
  something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus
  your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it
  is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.

game: Joe And Mac - Caveman Ninja
file: Joe & Mac Caveman Ninja .zip
developer: Takara
publisher: Takara
description:
  The game stars the green-haired Joe and the blue-haired Mac, cavemen who battle
  though numerous prehistoric levels using, weapons such as boomerangs, bones,
  fire, flints, electricity, stone wheels, and clubs. The objective of the game is
  simply rescuing a group of girls who were kidnapped by a rival tribe of cavemen.
  The gameplay is somewhat similar to Contra and has a Gauntlet-style health
  system, where the player loses health over a period of time apart from in boss
  battles. This health system is also not unlike that of Sega's Wonder Boy. The
  game could be played in either single player or two player mode. In the two
  player mode, both characters could hurt each other. The game was also notable
  for its cartoony graphics, humor, and sound effects.
  .
  The original arcade version had the distinction of allowing the player to select
  between different routes (much like Taito's Darius) at the end of a boss battle.
  Also, after defeating the final boss, the players can choose between three
  exits, each one leading to a slightly different ending sequence.

game: Speedball 2
file: Speed Ball 2 - Brutal Deluxe.zip
developer: The Bitmap Brothers
publisher: The Bitmap Brothers
description:
  Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team
  Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their
  fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and
  challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of
  which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who
  progresses.
  .
  You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They
  consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and
  frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and
  tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or
  freeze the opponents.
  .
  The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the
  ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can
  sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars
  which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier
  activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the
  same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the
  stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the
  pitch, in the direction it was going.
  .
  You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear
  on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either
  on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better
  ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved
  to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use
  of them is important.
  .
  A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your
  team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.

game: Gaiares

developer: Renovation Products
publisher: Renovation Products
description:
  It's the year 300x.  The Earth has been ravaged by careless humans, leaving an
  uninhabitable, polluted wasteland.  The space terrorists, Gulfer, plan to
  harvest the pollution to make some sort of garbage weapon. The good guys, the
  Leezaluth, aren't happy about that, so they decide they have to blow up the
  Earth before Gulfer gets at it.  They give Earth an ultimatum: destroy Gulfer or
  Leezaluth destroys Earth. To help them out, Leezaluth gives Earth's last hero,
  Dan, a special weapon: the TOZ system.
  .
  Why don't the Leezaluth just stop Gulfer themselves?  It's not exactly clear.
  .
  So, we have the premise for a side scrolling shooter. The star attraction here
  is the TOZ system. The TOZ is an orb that follows your ship around, and can be
  shot at enemy ships to absorb their weapons. Using the TOZ, Dan will fight
  through 8 stages filled with lots of enemies and really large bosses.

description:
  One year after the first edition of the World Fighting Tournament, won by Lau
  Chan, invitations are sent once again, this time to the second edition of the
  Tournament. Will Akira's new techniques be enough to beat Wolf? Can Lau defend
  his title against his daughter Pai? Will Jacky rescue his sister Sarah, who has
  been brainwashed to kill him? Will Jeffry make enough money to track down the
  Satan Shark? And Kage, will he uncover if the mysterious Judgement 6 cartel is
  behind the tournament? All is yet to be seen...
  .
  Sharing the name with the second title in Sega's seminal 3D fighter series, this
  16-bit version brings the game to the world of 2D fighters.
  .
  While the fully polygonal environment of the arcade/saturn version were
  scratched in favor of regular sprites and side-scrolling camera due to obvious
  technological constraints (plus  manufacturing costs ruling out the SVP chip
  used in Virtua Racing) and featuring only the 8 original characters in the
  series, the rest was directly taken or inspired by it's bigger brother. The
  arenas are all drawn according to the to the 32-bit titles (and even feature a
  small parallax scrolling trick to provide a slight 3D illusion), so are the
  characters, and the also features a lot of the same sound effects and music.
  Gameplay is also inspired by the original version, with many button combinations
  remaining unchanged.
