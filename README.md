# Installation

Disclaimer: You should have your SD card formatted as internal storage

1 Install [Pegasus Frontend](https://pegasus-frontend.org/#downloads) for Android

2 Download the rom folder present in this repository in the SD card or copy every metadata.pegasus.txt in every system rom folder that you already have

3 Place your roms in your SD card. We recommend using a FTP Server [like this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theolivetree.ftpserver)

4 Open Pegasus Frontend with Mouse mode off, press B, go to Settings, Gaming -> Set game directories.. and add every single metadata.pegasus.txt there is in every rom folder. Press B again so Pegasus can scrap the rom names

5 Download Media from here - (still uploading) or use [Skraper](http://skraper.net), selecting this types of media when scrapping:

- screenshot
- fanart
- box 2d
- wheel

Remember to set a maximum width of 160px so we download img adapted to our RP2

6 Install a cool theme, like [switchOS RP2 Edition](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/switchOS) or [gameOS RP2 Edition](https://github.com/dragoonDorise/gameOS).
